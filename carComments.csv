Is this much of an issue? It's rare that I see posts that don't have at least the make and model in them or when I do they're about something super non-specific e.g. 'Should I leave my foot on the clutch or shift to neutral at a red light?'.

"This kind of goes on already: The current Dodge Challenger.  Note, they kind of toss out the equation for its sister, the Charger.

"If someone tells you to put a new engine into your still working car they are taking your wallet for a ride.   Some cars run 100k (looking at you bmw), and some cars run 500k without a single oil change(they dont please change your oil regularly this is a joke). Its honestly all up to luck, the quality of the car, the maintenance, and how its used.  Generally an ounce of prevention is worth a pound if cure. If you take good care of it it will run well for a long time. Just stay up to date with the maintenance. If it needs a new engine you might awell get a new A new car.  Most cars at 200k + have alot more wear on them than just an engine. Suspension, rust, transmission, various fluids, ECU's etc. Alot of plastic bits like engine mounts crack. Unless its in superb condition its not worth dumping money into.   Also there's a difference between city and highway miles. 200,000 highway miles are like 10% of the ware that 200,000 city miles are.  Overall alot of factors determine the wear level on a car.

If that s4 is want don’t let automatic or manual hold you back.,"I recently bought my first manual transmission about a month ago, I live in an urban region. A lot of shitty and overloaded roads and highways with horrendous merges, weird slow moving exit ramps that are fairly steep inclines, Tight street parking, a lot of them on hills…basically what I’d imagine a worst case scenario for a new manual driver.  I don’t have to drive everyday but I love my GTI 6spd, it was a bit nerve wracking at first and I had some stalls that were in inconvenient places. I drive 3-4 days a week and don’t regret anything. For most it just becomes normal, you don’t really think about as much once you’re comfortable with the power bands of your gears and you know the sounds and feels of your car.

Your leg will get very tired and it's more hassle than it's worth.  If you live in a medium-sized city of a couple million people, you'll be fine.  I myself drive a 2014 Camaro SS 6 spd through Columbus, OH traffic just fine.  It's a pretty twitchy, heavy clutch and even it doesn't bother me.  When I had my Cruze (which had a very light, forgiving clutch), the only thing I didn't like was heavy Chicago rush hour jams where you spent an hour crawling at 5 MPH.    Still, there are tricks you can use to avoid wearing out your leg.  The best strategy is leaving distance between you and the car ahead so you can coast in 1st gear without needing to constantly stop/start.  People WILL jump in front of you but you just have to get over it and widen the gap again.  Overall, though, I wouldn't daily drive any manual transmission where the daily rush hour forces you to crawl for more than 45 minutes.  Hope this helps!",1

"The best thing you can do is be prepared.    Check out the options on your vehicle. Does the shifter have an ""M"" option? Or, after D(drive) does it have ""2"" and ""1""? This allows for manual shifting your automatic transmission, specifically shifting down.   Obviously situation dictates options, if you're doing 80 on the freeway and find you have no brakes, you might not want to go straight down to 2nd gear. But below 40mph, you can shift down to 2nd and the engine will slow the vehicle. Then below about 15mph you could go down to 1st, then shut off the vehicle and coast to a stop.    Another tip, if your brakes go out, do **NOT** shut the vehicle off! You'll lose power steering and make stopping safely harder.    If you're going very fast, shift the vehicle to N (neutral) and apply light pressure to your emergency brake. It won't stop you immediately, but you can slowly add more pressure to safely slow down without burning out your only brake.","What's it got, Stuntman?",1

Turn the radio up.,"I saw a video saying if you lose control of your car, put it in neutral. The video displayed an SUV but I also read it in an “article” for sedans. The video says that pulling your key out of the ignition will just cause the steering wheel to lock when you try to turn, and another thing I’m forgetting. But it ends with saying to put your car in neutral if it’s accelerating and you can’t stop it.",1

Happy to be the first to comment as I just sold my car for $2k to a guy that seemed normal and he was.  Having said that my car had half the mileage and was a Toyota so it was a fair deal ....   What was the KBV of it?  If it was close to KBV for the given condition forget about it - tell him it was a fair deal and that you have already contacted the police about potential harassment concerns (and then actually do that - they won’t be mad). If you sold it over the KBV (substantially) and something maintenance-wise broke maybe consider a partial refund or just buy it back.    You should always sell used cars with a “no warranty” disclaimer when you make a bill of sale / receipt so people cannot hold anything over your head once they pay you and take possession.  Legally you’re probably fine here but for peace of mind consider if you think you actually ripped the guy off at all.    May be worth a grand or two / try to sell it to someone else versus letting this hang over your head for days / weeks / etc.  good luck.    Don’t hesitate to contact police if things get weird.  They will contact the guy or show up on his door step which may make him stop.,"Police is informed so you can't do anything there, he paid in cash so no need to worry about chargebacks or whatever.  Unless he does something illegal, the worst you can expect is him bringing the car back, to which you don't have to react.  Do not block his number though, idiots like to warn you about the stupid and illegal shit they might want to try",0

"An e9x 328i (2006-2012ish) would be a better buy, they are considerably more reliable, modern, and safer than their e46 predecessors.   For either car, you should be prepared to work on it yourself, doing things like oil changes, brake jobs, and potentially things like cooling system repairs.  Parts are reasonably priced thanks to websites like FCPEuro, and there are DIY videos and forum posts for pretty much anything you’d need to do on these cars.","Honestly if you're concerned enough to ask about reliability, buying a 5-15 (in the case of the 330ci) year old BMW probably should not be on your radar.  Buy a Camry/Corolla, a Civic/Accord, or a more recent Kia/Hyundai that has that crazy ten year warranty if you were so inclined. You can also look at older Lexus/Acura models, which have a similar reliability rep.   There is a reason they're looked on as boring/safe cars, it's because they run with little drama for a long time.   Save money, buy something nice later.

Just slowly let out the clutch in 1st gear until you feel the car start to move... you'll hear and feel the engine bog down a little bit.  Push the clutch back in all the way and repeat until you can hit that spot every time. Once you've got that skill mastered, climbing through the gears is a piece of cake.",1
"I've been driving manuals for years but I find certain cars are great to drive with a manual while others are really rough or notchy. The two issues are the shifter throw, some are super loose and it's hard to find the gear, then others might have a heavy clutch pedal. I drove a friend's Mustang that was really hard to drive, then a Miata which was silky smooth.   If you find a nice shifting car, learning will be super easy!","It took me about... 5 min to learn how to not stall the car every stop? 10 min or so to get it to not stall 8 out of 10 times. About a week to memorize which speed is most suited for which gear, mostly for downshifting. Then about a month to be  about 90% smooth with up and down shifts.  Also don’t do like in the race cars and downshift through every gear. It’s not needed for street driving and it’ll accelerate wear on your clutch. Coming to a stop, just let it slide in gear until rpm drops too low, then put shifter into neutral. Brake pads much cheaper than clutches.",0
"Couple weeks.   I'd say, depending on how you learn.  Everyone is different.  I replaced a clutch in my father's car before I ever tried to drive a manual.

"google says GVWR is 4321 - 4630 lbs and curb weight is 3219 - 3492lbs so your car can carry 829-1,411lbs depending on exactly which curb weight and GVWR you have. Keep in mind, that includes the weight of you and anyone else in the car. If it's just you in the car and you weigh 200lbs you can take between 12 and 24 bags. If you look in your door jamb you can find the actual GVWR and get a more accurate answer.   So to answer your question, yes you can probably do it in two trips.",The 2018 sonata has a payload capacity of betweek 1100 and 1200 lbs.   Now... That includes you and anything else in the car.

"Okay I used to work for an oil company. Don't work don't anymore but I wont mention the name.  Fuel standards are heavily regulated. As long as the tank at the station isn't getting rained into or whatever it will not harm your car.   As long as you use gas with enough octane it makes little difference.  Also most gas comes from the same refinery no matter who owns it. That's a simple logistics fact.  BUT there are still several differences between brands of gas. Because the gas that's created in the refinery has no additives in it yet. Each oil company that has a contract with other oil companies has their own filling station on the grounds of the refinery. There they will add additive packages to the gas that differ between manufacturers. No major differences, all manufacturers want the same overall goals, they just go about it differently or they might think one aspect to be more important than the others.  It's been a while since I talked to the main gas researcher but of the top of my head she said something along the lines of  Shell has great anti foaming agent (gas foams less so you can fill up quicker), Aral/BP has a superior cleaning agent, Total does a good job with the octane booster in their gas (excellium 100).  The one major difference in our market was the 102 octane stuff that Aral(german BP gas brand) sells because that is only created in one BP owned refinery and they ship it everywhere in germany where it's used.  Oh and mpg can vary between gas brands because some additives can influence the thermal energy of gas. Like ethanol. Awesome for octane, shit for fuel consumption. But iirc ethanol is the heaviest hitter there and even that doesnt influence it thaaaat much when we aren't talking about e85","Any difference would be negligible, but in general it really shouldn’t matter where you get gas from",1

In the mid 70's the Japanese manufacturing mindset changed.

Similar tightening went into every aspect of engineering and manufacturing.  We see the result today.  For the most part.",1
Less stuff under the hood and tried and proven technology would make a car reliable. Newer and more complicated and smaller engines with turbos would be considered unreliable. Also cvt transmissions are still newer and still kind of have a certain stigma with them.,"Generally the more complicated the car is in terms of electronic things the less reliable it is. Japanese cars in the early 90s and 2000s generally had less electronic things in the car. Also they didn't feel the need to update the interior drastically every 2 years(or so it seems with american cars.) So the components were more mature and had more time to iron out the electronic gremlins.   But like others have said, there are american cars that are built like tanks and will run forever.  In conclusion, just buy a Toyota Camry and you won't have to worry about another car for at least 15 years given you take care of it.",0

They destroyed domestic automakers by making great small cars and dominated that market.  U.S. auto makers were hit hard by the oil crisis and CARB emissions requirements in the 70s. They had all these huge cars with big V8 engines and they couldn't pivot away from that fast enough. They had already dumped the money into R&D and had to make due with what they had. That's why you have late 70s cars with 500ci V8s making 200hp. They were choked with emissions equipment. Cars overall got slower and tastes changed as Americans moved away from land barges. The Japanese cars filled a niche and gained a great reputation for reliability. The U.S. companies didn't seem to care about small cars so they made half hearted entries and focused on trucks and SUVs. I would say in the last ten years or so things have evened out. Toyota still makes good cars but so does Ford and so does Hyundai. I don't think you can go by the brand, you need to research the car and see if there are problems specific to that model.

"One of those faults of the way our brains assess risk is that people would rather scrap their current car with its known problem and known cost to repair and replace it with a used car with *unknown* problems because they no longer ""trust"" their current car. This might be a good gamble if the replacement car were new or a high-dollar late model used car, but they're often trying to replace a $3000 car that needs a $2000 repair one-to-one with a $5000 car.  There is a question of whether it's ever worth it to hold on if a car has a known design flaw/chronic problem that's just going to come back, but it's something you can figure in to the long-term running cost if you're really savvy.",IMO some combination of  1) Cost to fix above selling price (reasonably rational decision)  2) Want to internally justify buying something else (irrational decision)  3) Willing to pay something for newer features and cost of major repair swings the calculus in that favor (semi rational if related to safety)  4) Believe the car is about to become a money pit and don't want to deal with it (semi rational decision),0

"My experience with two cars with CVTs has been very positive.  I own a 2014 Altima 2.5S with 102K miles purchased new and a 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage DE CVT with 82K miles purchased in 2016 with 27K miles.  So, I have 160K miles roughly between two cars and have had absolutely no issues with either.  I am fastidious with maintenance (regular oil changes, engine coolant replacement, and CVT fluid replacement which I believe will extend the life of the CVTs in both vehicles.  Yes, the CVTs in Nissans are hit or miss but not everyone can get a bad one, can they?  As to how CVTs drive, they are adequate as I drive mostly on the highway with minimal elevation changes at a constant velocity which most understand does not require any shifting.   Some consider a CVT boring or slow.  In my Altima it is not slow but it definitely lacks the fun of driving a manual.",My wife's has a car with a cvt for a few years it's been fine.

I've always liked yellow calipers (or gold like on Subarus etc), especially on darker coloured cars.","On road cars I think Porsche did it first with red calipers as a signifier of a big brake package. The 964 Turbo and Carrera 4 had them, sometime around 1991. The 928 S4 might have had them earlier, not sure.  In the early '90s a lot of the kind of exotics and higher end sports cars that came with monoblock calipers didn't really show them off. The typical OEM wheel styles back then were still very aero, flat faced, not the spindly lightweight look that shows off the brakes. The Ferrari 348 and 512TR for example had dark grey calipers. Aftermarket racing calipers like wilwood, AP, etc. tended to be black or grey back then too. Brembo kind of stood out using gold (as seen on the Skyline GT-R V-spec or the McLaren F1).  The Lancer Evolution V (1998) was the first sort of affordable/mass produced car I can think of that had red calipers, though they were still big ass Brembos; the first time I remember seeing boring normal sliding calipers painted red from the factory was the VW GTI 337 edition (25th anniversary model).",0

You want a real challenge?

But, if you're at the front of the line, you'll usually be in position to see the cross lights, and even the pedestrian count down timer if there is one.      The national average on time between one light going red, to the cross traffic going green is about 3 seconds.

"If the pump didn’t shut off, something is wrong with your fuel evap system. Get your engine light error code read by a parts shop/mechanic.  What might’ve happened was fuel entered into the evap lines","People who are telling you that there is no such thing as excess gas are wrong and don't know what they're talking about.  It is entirely likely that liquid fuel has entered the fuel evaporative emission control (""EVAP"") system.  This system is designed to capture fuel *vapors* from evaporated fuel and send them to the engine to be burned instead of being vented into the atmosphere every time you open your gas cap.  Normally this is a very small amount of fuel that doesn't disrupt the performance of the engine, but liquid fuel making its way through this system is a problem.  This is due to the fact that fuel entering the engine in this fashion is not regulated by the engine computer and is not atomised into a fine spray by the fuel injectors.    So, your engine runs poorly because the computer can no longer maintain the proper air-to-fuel ratio necessary to ensure proper and complete combustion.  There is major concern here, because this can actually cause a condition known as ""hydro locking"" under the right circumstances.  This is fatal to an engine in short order.  This happens when a liquid such as water or fuel enters the engine in sufficient amounts to fill the combustion chamber.  Since liquids are generally not compressible, this stops the piston dead in its tracks.  Something has to give under the immense pressure, and that's usually your piston rods, which get sent flying out of the block.  This would be unrepairable and require a new engine.  I strongly recommend not driving the car and towing it to a mechanic to have the evap system drained and repaired.  Send the bill to the gas station.  Best of luck, OP.",0

Don't forget cars made before 1995 often didn't have airbags. My S13 never did. No way to install a working airbag into it.

"Would you include a relay as a ""computer"" ?  If yes, you'll have to go waaaay back.

easiest thing to do so you know you get the correct part is just go to the dealership. Give them your VIN and they will get you the correct part. And the quality will be good. Should not have any issues and usually they are not that more expensive then the ones at the part stores.. And the ones from part stores can have a huge range of quality.,"I'm about to give you the best advice. If you are going to do any maintenance on your vehicle, you should get a Haynes or Chilton manual at your local Auto parts store, or get one on Amazon.  It has all fluid types, amounts and  step-by-step instructions on how to do all (most) of the normal (and advanced) procedures on  your vehicle. Everything from types of spark plugs to brakes to differential fluid. It is SO helpful in a pinch and will save you money. That and searching Youtube for procedures. You're welcome :)",0

"I was driving a 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis up until 2019. Most of the time it was fine but every year or so it needed a major repair. The axel seals were leaking and destroyed the bearings and wore a grove in the axels. The lower ball joints had to be replaced once along with rear shocks. AC system needed work a few times. The fuel pump died, the intake manifold cracked and leaked coolant, the ABS model died. So it was mostly just parts wearing out. I did some of the work myself but sometimes I just needed the car to get to work so I paid a shop.   In short the car nickle and dimed me but I loved driving it and it was always cheaper to repair it than buy a new car. In 2019 the transmission died and that was it. I bought a new Ford Fusion and it’s been flawless so far. I think you have to really love the car and do a lot of your own maintenance to make it worth it.

"I was driving a 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis up until 2019. Most of the time it was fine but every year or so it needed a major repair. The axel seals were leaking and destroyed the bearings and wore a grove in the axels. The lower ball joints had to be replaced once along with rear shocks. AC system needed work a few times. The fuel pump died, the intake manifold cracked and leaked coolant, the ABS model died. So it was mostly just parts wearing out. I did some of the work myself but sometimes I just needed the car to get to work so I paid a shop.   In short the car nickle and dimed me but I loved driving it and it was always cheaper to repair it than buy a new car. In 2019 the transmission died and that was it. I bought a new Ford Fusion and it’s been flawless so far. I think you have to really love the car and do a lot of your own maintenance to make it worth it. Having a second car really helps with that too.","I daily drive an 18 year old BMW with 252k on it. It runs like a damn train.

"100% depends on the previous owner, and if service has been done.   Many people are quick to claim that all ""old"" or used cars are unreliable, becuase that is their anecdotal experience with them. ALOT of people seem to just stop doing any sort of service once the car is over a certain age, the ""as long as it drives"" mentality. If you don't keep up with the service in a modern car you'll end up with an unreliable junker in 15 years just the same.","I daily drive a 25 year old truck that was a work truck for most of that.

I’ve got a mechanic that knows the brand well, I like to take care of it, and it would be hypocritical of me to criticize people with the money to have obscenely expensive cars and not drive them, while also wanting to own older cars and pretend I have to tuck them away in a similar manner.  The car currently sits at around 72k miles since I’ve bought it, and I can think of very few moments I’ve spent not smiling during those miles.","Basically 15 years isn't far enough back to make any kind of distinction.

The axel seals were leaking and destroyed the bearings and wore a grove in the axels. The lower ball joints had to be replaced once along with rear shocks. AC system needed work a few times. The fuel pump died, the intake manifold cracked and leaked coolant, the ABS model died. So it was mostly just parts wearing out. I did some of the work myself but sometimes I just needed the car to get to work so I paid a shop.   In short the car nickle and dimed me but I loved driving it and it was always cheaper to repair it than buy a new car. In 2019 the transmission died and that was it. I bought a new Ford Fusion and it’s been flawless so far. I think you have to really love the car and do a lot of your own maintenance to make it worth it.

"Did a wheel bearing and oil change on my roommate's 99 Maxima. Drained the oil while I had it in the air, did the wheel bearing, forgot to put the oil back in. The 3 day $500 oil change.  I no longer do oil changes for anyone.   http://imgur.com/HhID1xG","So I have this 91 turbo mr2. I'm in love with it. I spun a rod bearing. I have the factory service manuals so I take it upon myself to rebuild the engine. I also rebuild the transmission while it's out. Upgrade the synchros, rebuild the engine. Everything is great. I've got basically a brand new car that I built myself. The passenger window won't roll down at the end of it all. I spent 3 days diagnosing the electrical system. Called a friend over because I needed an extra set of eyes to help fix this. My boy showed up, fiddled with it for 10 seconds, and the window miraculously went down. I look over and he's laughing so hard that he couldn't breathe. My window lock was on. I can rebuild a 3sgte, but a window lock button was witchcraft apparently.",0
"I drained the transmission oil out of our LeMons car instead of the engine oil.

I drove that car hard and fast and generally abused the shit out of it. I lived in the mountains at the time and theres this spot on one of the roads, Rose Hill IIRC, which if you're going fast enough is a ridiculously fun and stupidly dangerous jump. I hit it at about 50 and upon landing all my rusty ass exhaust manifold bolts stretch and/or broke and the manifold itself basically fell apart and ripped a fuel line. I drove about a mile and a half with flame licking up around the edges of the engine bay. Pull into the fire department screaming for help and jumping around like a retard. They put it out, I walked down the street to Car Quest and got some fuel line and hooked it back up and drove it home. She sounded like a Mac truck for a couple weeks.  I didn't realize it at the time but it broke my battery strap too and a couple days later I pulled into a parking lot and as I'm walking away I smell burning. Come back to the car and theres a little tiny flame shooting out of one corner of the hood. Not a gap between the hood and fender, literally through the hood, about the size of a pilot light and theres a black bubbling circle of paint expanding around the hood. I popped the hood as fast as I could and levered it open and the battery is on fucking fire, big time. I ran into the KMart and ripped an extinguisher off the wall and ran back with the staff yelling at me and put the fire out. 100 bucks for the extinguisher (fucking robbery) and I got it towed home.  So time finally comes I'm going to replace the header and electrical cables and some other shit that burned or was damaged, my dad is helping me out. I didn't pay much attention to what my dad was doing because he taught me everything I knew at this point so I just deferred to his expertise in most things. Turns out he routed the negative cable wrong and the wire was touching the exhaust. I got about two more days out of it before there was another engine fire. Same parking lot, fortunately I had my own extinguisher this time.  So for a while there the cops and Fire Dep knew me as the guy with the forest green Fox thats usually on FUCKING FIRE!",0
"Best thing for a car is not to store it.  Start it and drive it once a month for at least 20 minutes.  If that is not possible, then fill the tank with fuel and disconnect the battery.  Store indoors if possible.  Periodically check on the car to make sure that the tires are aired up.  If rodents are potentially a problem, then put traps in the car and check every week.","KBB says $4K-$7K, Good condition, 160K miles...

If your wheels and tires are the wrong size, then yes your odometer is wrong. But if they're not, then likely your odometer is correct. Auto makers skew speeds higher because it's safer than the alternative. In my BMW I can turn the skew on or off with some simple coding, the car knows how fast it's really going, and the odometer is accurate, but my speed always reads 2-3mph higher than actual.",1

Generally, track guys depending on suspension design are looking for between 2.5-4* negative camber, so that when they load up that corner of the car, the tire becomes as flat to the pavement as possible.

Generally, going beyond those numbers is purely a style thing, actively making the car worse as by adding more negative camber, you're reducing the amount of tire that's on the ground when the car is going straight, meaning you can't use the full capacity of your brakes, and you can't put down all the power you may be making.",Too look like an idiot tbh.,1

Like if I suddenly had in my possession a $100K, that would be super expensive to me and while I wouldn't double park like a piece of shit, I might park a little further out and walk a little further. However some people regard a $100k car like I regard a $1k beater and wouldn't think twice about parking it anywhere and everywhere. Which just goes to show that double parking has nothing to do with the cost **or** the perceived value of a vehicle. It has everything to do with how selfish and entitled a person is.

"Idling at a light: good. Depressing the clutch can place wear on various parts, so putting it in neutral when not moving is the proper thing to do.   Coasting down a hill: generally not the best idea. 1) if something happens and you need to make evasive maneuvers, you are not fully in control of the car. 2) you actually use less fuel if you keep it in gear while going downhill. 3) the engine braking effect going downhill can save some wear on your actual brakes.","You're doing it right, friend.  Holding the clutch in for too long will, over time, wear out your throw-out bearing, which could mean an early clutch replacement (even if your clutch disk still has some life in it, you might as well replace it while you're in there).

Sure, it's only a small amount more but at the end of the day you need to set limits and stay within them when it comes to car design. $2 more on an oil drain plug seems meaningless, and it is. But why is a magnetic oil drain plug more important than spending $2 on any of 1,000 other random parts.  Cars contain tens of thousands of parts and every single one of those parts has a budget that they need to stay within in order to hit a certain price point for the total vehicle. Would a magnetic oil drain plug be nice, yes it would.    But the REAL question here is, would it sell more vehicles.  If you compared it to spending a few bucks more on the climate control knob to make it have a more satisfying click.  I'd argue that the climate knob having a nice click will sell more cars than a magnetic oil drain plug.  In fact, I'd wager that the vast majority of car buyers (even ones that change their own oil) have no idea if their car has a magnetic grain plug or not prior to purchasing the vehicle.   I'd honestly be shocked if it resulted in more than a handful of additional sales.  Not nearly enough additional sales to justify spending $2 more on every single vehicle they make.",0

The codes I remember looking up relate to multiple cylinder misfire, a faulty engine oil sensor, and a bad TCM. (P0300, 522, and 700 are the ones I remember.)    Basically I always worry when I'm going over 50 MPH because a long while ago I was going up a hilly section of a parkway when the car decided to drop maybe 2 gears and jump to 5k RPMs, and then it stayed in that one gear for the rest of that ride until I turned the car off.  The car had no low end torque whatsoever when it was stuck in that one gear.  I rarely use it now and my dad is only using it as a daily to work.  But when I do I try not to floor it too hard or else I'll drop 2 gears again.",1
"I put 205,000 miles on a 2006 Mazda 6.  I bought it new, originally for my wife to use for an hour long commute, but then we moved, and it became my car for an hour long commute.  She drove it for the first 125k, I drove it the rest.  I sold it in 2016 to a friend who drove it another 25,000 miles, but by then it leaked oil, and she forgot to top it off, so that finally killed it sometime in 2018.  Edit:  When the car had less than 30,000 miles, we took it to a shop for an oil change.  We dropped it off in the afternoon, and picked it up first thing in the morning so my wife could drive to work.  She made it almost all the way when the engine overheated, and all the dash lights went crazy.  The shop didn't install the oil filter properly, and it lost all the oil, jumped timing, etc.  It was towed to a dealership, where they reset the timing, and put a new oil filter cap on it.  It ran perfectly after that.  When we moved in 2012, we tried to sell the car to my wife's brother, but he didn't know how to drive a stick shift.  He destroyed the clutch after 5 days, then refused to pay for the car, or the damage, so we put a clutch in it, and drove the ""piece of shit"" (as he called it) for another 80,000 mostly trouble free miles.  I had to put a wheel bearing in it at 175,000 miles, and replace the catalytic converter at 190,000 miles, but otherwise, it was just oil changes, brakes, and tires.","I'm currently at 230,000 miles on my 2014 Mustang GT.",0

"This is one of the worst bullshit ever. I change my transmission fluids every year on my track car, and I can tell you than changing it will cause more problem than the opposite.  That's the same BS than the guys stating that using synthetic fluid will cause an engine to leak.  If your transmission fails following an oil change, it was about to fail anyway.","3 auto makers -- Honda, Chrysler, and Kia, have recommended against flushing transmissions, but Honda terminology says draining and refilling the transmission 3 times is flushing it. Apparently GM allows flushing the transmission by pumping fluid through it, but they require using a tool that limits the pumping pressure.    The idea against a power flush is that pumping fluid will kick up debris that's long settled in the valve body and can make the valves get stuck.",0

"It's a little easier to cut fuel completely than to try to figure out exactly how much fuel/timing/etc is needed to maintain a specific engine speed, especially when outside conditions like throttle open % can vary so much despite it redlining. It has the added bonus of giving the driver a very clear ""Something is wrong, stop doing that"" behavior.  FWIW most stock cars use a fuel cut instead of a spark cut. Sending unburnt fuel down a hot exhaust can be dangerous. Some aftermarket launch controllers/2steps use a spark cut because that unburnt fuel can be used to spool turbos. But still, dangerous for the components involved.","It depends on the car, the ones with electronic throttles don't bounce because they just hold the throttle.",0

"My Saab used to have a Dark Panel button. When driving in the very dark, it puts out all but the basic dashboard lights. Run low on fuel? Gauge lights up. Engine temp? Lights up if necessary. It makes a surprising difference in visibility in the dark.  Funny, the speedo only lit to 140kph unless you exceeded that. Once a cute girl in the backseat leaned forward and asked ""Your car only goes to 140?"" I said ""watch,"" downshifted and floored it. It lit up the second half (up to 250kph,which she interpreted as the car's actual top speed).  I think she was genuinely impressed.

"What car do you have?  Make, model, year, mileage?  Some general advice:  Make sure you know how to check your fluids and what goes where. Windshield washer fluid, oil, coolant, transmission fluid.  Windshield washer fluid: A blue cap with a picture of a windshield being squirted. You can fill this all the way to the top. If you live in a cold climate make sure you get a winter blend to prevent freezing.   Oil: Dipstick is usually yellow color. With engine at operating temperature and off remove the dipstick, wipe it clean and push it all the way back in and then pull out to read the level. There should be 2 lines on it. A minimum and maximum. It should be up to the top line but in between is fine. Generally from the bottom line to the top line is a quart difference but not always. If there is nothing on the dipstick then add oil. Make sure to use the correct weight oil. It is usually printed on the cap. If it is a little high it is not the end of the world. If you go too high and it starts foaming that is a problem and you need to drain the excess.  Coolant: There is an overflow bottle with a low and high mark or a cold and hot mark. When cold it should be at the cold level and when hot up to the hot mark. You can add coolant into the reservoir at any time. As far as the actual radiator, NEVER take off a radiator cap when the engine is hot. The coolant will turn to steam and burn you if you remove the cap when hot. When the engine is COLD you can remove the cap and the coolant should be at the top of the radiator. If not, add coolant directly to the radiator. There are different coolants which are usually color coded so pay attention to color.  Transmission fluid: Generally don't worry about this unless there is an issue.  Brakes: The pads have metal tabs on them that make a scratching noise against the rotor when you need to replace them. You can also look through your rims and see the outside pad for how much material is left   Tires: Make sure they are always filled to the proper pressure. The amount will be listed on the inside of the drivers door jamb. In the winter the pressure will naturally drop so when it gets cold make sure the check again. You set your tire pressure when cold without driving. The pressure will increase sightly while driving. Under inflating will wear the 2 outside edges. Over inflating will wear the center of the tire.  Engine air filter: Check owners manual for when it should be replaced. Depends on driving conditions or if it is dusty and such. Very easy to replace yourself so don't get tricked into paying a shop to do it. You can buy the filter online or from the dealership for pretty cheap. Usually like $20.  Cabin air filter: People usually forget to replace these but helps keep the air from your air conditioning system clean. It is usually located behind the glove box and is also easy to change. Generally unclip some things on the glove box and it will drop down and you can just replace the filter. Another thing mechanics severely overcharge for. These filters are cheap as well.  If you have specific questions feel free to ask. There are many parts to a car and a lot to cover.","I second the Haynes manual for your specific make and model!

Personally, I throw things.","Haynes manual and youtube videos helped me. I also joined a forum for my specific car and found and fixed a problem that would have cost me a lot to repair, but was a simple fix, once i got it apart.  Try doing something like changing spark plugs or oil to get your confidence up. GET GLOVES when you change your oil. Used oil has all kinds of nasty stuff in it. i wear those thin surgical kind of gloves under a pair of thicker rubber gloves because i change the oil when it's warm or hot (drains out faster and more completely that way).  If you want to try a super simple maintenance thing, replace your air filter. You may not even need tools to do it.",1

The actual wrench turning isnt step by step unless you have a basic understanding of what hes doing already (he makes videos for service tech out there on the job). If you wanted to start doing the wrenching yourself id recommend asking around if anyone has a broken old mower/weed whacker/chainsaw that they dont want because its broken and/or wont start and try to fix it up and get it running again. Wont cost much if you cant do it but if you do you can make a tennie bit of profit to buy more tools with!",0

(Just dumping the clutch on a down shift would be wrong lol) I'm not sure if you hold your clutch down the entire time your braking but you definitely don't have to, only when your RPM is going to be low.

Or if u want skip to around 4 mins.   https://youtu.be/8YIDOjD0oBI,"I'm not sure about V6 and V10, but cars with only 3 cylinders (at least here in Brazil there are a lot now, with 1 liter engines - Chevrolet Onix, Hyundai HB20, Nissan Versa, Dacia Kwid and Sandero and even the emblematic VW Gol) tend to not get over 100k kilometers. They eventually will break due to the vibration, which comes from having an odd number of cylinders. When you have a even number of cylinders the vibration and load will be (ahem) evenly distributed.  I'm talking here about inline engines (3 and 4 cylinders), I'm not sure how much of this applies to V engines. But I believe the theory applies, maybe the practical side not so much.",1

"Do people really hate automatic transmission? I haven't seen stuff like that in the car community, just a few comments saying manual transmission is more enjoyable to drive than an automatic one but that's about it.","Edit: More than traditional automatics, I mostly see CVTs (fancy new automatics without traditional ""gears"") catching heat for 1. Unreliability and expensive repairs and 2. They don't have gears, so your car will sound lame as it accelerates.  YMMV on the second point, but the first is valid. These are new enough to production cars that they haven't been dialed-in by most automakers yet, including JATCO (49% Nissan), who makes them on behalf of many other brands. Do note though, that Toyota makes a basically bulletproof CVT as of the mid 2000s, and I'm not current on the data, so other brands may be catching up. Do some research (NHTSA reports, Car Complaints website, etc.) if looking into buying a car with a CVT.  Manuals used to get much better fuel economy than automatics and were cheaper and more reliable as well. These days it's mostly a preference thing, a lot of people like shifting and being more directly in control of the powertrain.   Nevertheless, it's worth stating that there *are* some notorious model years that have terribly unreliable automatics but bulletproof manuals, such as early 2000s Hondas, or 90% of all vehicles Chrysler ever made. The engine on an 02 Civic might go forever after you replace the head gasket at 190k, but the automatic transmission is going to need a rebuild pretty soon... And then another at 300k. The manuals never need anything except perhaps a new clutch once or twice in ~400k miles",0

"In the bad old days Autos were inefficient, sloppy, slow, and generally looked down on as being for people who were incapable of driving a manual.  These days autos are (mostly) pretty good, efficient, sometimes faster shifting than a human etc. depending on the exact type.  However, manuals still offer the ""ultimate"" amount of control, to paraphrase a gearbox guy ""no-one's built a gearbox yet that can see what's coming"".  Off-road in technical stuff a manual offers some advantages - you can do things with a manual + clutch that are just not possible with an auto. However, an auto does make going up a climb a much easier prospect and they're kinder to the drivetrain because the torque converter tends to smooth out any shock loads.  I prefer a manual in my off-roader as it's more survivable too - it can live or be limped home  with all sorts of damage or abuse that would stop an auto from functioning at all.  I'm not going to say one is better than the other as there's no right answer, they have as many pros and cons as each other, so it's pretty much down to a personal choice.  In a sports car or off-roader I'd have a manual, but if I was driving in a city or bad traffic every day I'd probably go auto and save my clutch leg.","I've always loved driving manual shitboxes just because it makes driving slightly more fun over an auto.

"I understand that its different i various countries, but where I'm from, probably 90% of all cars are manual. So I have never driven anything else.  Here its common knowledge that you NEVER keep the clutch halfway pressed. By trail and error you learn to find the ""clutch-point"" (dont know the English word for this phenomenon) where the clutch disengages and your adequate acceleration makes you drive forward. You need to practice to learn this and you will find that the ""clutch-point"" can vary greatly from car to car. Sometimes the clutch is very tight and hard to press, while the shifts are firm too. Other times it feels like pushing a cloud with your foot while stirring a bowl of soup with your arm.

"I answered... I'm a weirdo when it comes to cars though, so I hope I hope I don't skew your results too much.","My thoughts on EVs.... They could make them more stylish and sporty.   They are good for local commutes, but not yet practical for long road trips like gas powered cars.   Until they can get a full charge in under 10 minutes, still 2-3 times longer than filling up the tank with gasoline, they will not be useful for multiple state travel distances.",0

"I answered... I'm a weirdo when it comes to cars though, so I hope I hope I don't skew your results too much.",My issues with EVs are pricing and styling.    They're extremely expensive compared to their ICE counterparts.  Styling is atrocious these days as most models have featureless flat panels where the grille would normally be located.  Come on...  Have some creativity.    I hope that Dodge and Chevy knock it out of the park with their muscle car EVs.  Whichever manufacturer rolls the first electric muscle car onto showroom floors is the one that's getting my V8 Camaro trade-in.,0
"I answered... I'm a weirdo when it comes to cars though, so I hope I hope I don't skew your results too much.","EVs are probably good for daily drivers. They're efficient and as a commuter can be charged at home... assuming you have some way to install a charging port at home. Outside of first world cities, I'd REALLY have to be an EV enthusiast to buy one as the infrastructure isn't there yet.  I myself am interested in hybrids. Freedoms of a regular car with the battery powering AC and whatever else during traffic jams. Yea the battery will go bad in a decade, but so will pure EVs... But at least i still have an engine.  Also I'd like to add... a few years back Singapore charged Tesla Model S a kind of gas guzzling tax usually meant for high horsepower cars which I actually agree with. These Model S and cars like the Tycan while efficient at lower speeds, they do have the ability to go really fast and use up a lot of energy much like the regular ICE high performance cars. So it stands to reason electric cars should be charged a tax like this for models like the Model S Plaid which would maybe help subsidize actual efficient daily commuter EVs and maybe get their prices a bit lower.",0

"First the shop offered to make it right, and it's now right. You got the service that you paid for and it's done. Second don't ever go back to that shop.  Here is where you got B.S.ed and also what you could have done better. First if you're brakes failed you stop driving and call a tow truck.(the shop that did the work will pay for it.) Next you take it back to the shop and have them fix it, or you take it to the dealer and get it fixed. If you go to the dealer you're looking at getting your $600+the tow+ the parts/labor the dealer said were broken because of shotty work back from the shop. If you take it back to the shop they are going to fix it best they can and send you on your way.  As far as the shop they messed a bunch of things up. First anytime you do brakes you should go for a test drive and make sure they work. (if the shop doesn't feel safe driving the car why should you) Second if they blead the brakes (which they should for a brake job) they should have noticed the missing bolt.  If I was you I would take it into the dealer and pay for a brake inspection. If anything else is messed up it would be better to find it at the dealer then on the road in 2000 miles.

"Hey, OP -- first, familiarize yourself with where this car's clutch engages. On a totally flat surface (car shouldn't roll when in neutral with no brakes), in a wide open expanse (think: empty parking lot) do this: push the clutch pedal all the way to the floor. Put the car in 1st. Keep your right foot off and away from the gas pedal and the brake -- this is a left foot exercise only. Slooooooowly raise your left foot. It's different for every car, some engage right on the floor, and some have a bit of free play before the clutch starts to engage. Keep slooooooowly inching your foot up. You'll feel the clutch engage, and the vehicle will start slowly moving forward. Your goal is to move your left foot slowly enough that the car starts moving without stalling (and without using the gas pedal). Yes, this is a little hard on the clutch, but the finesse you will learn from it is worth doing it a few times and should thus save wear in the long run.   Next, familiarize yourself with keeping engine revs constant. Hit the e-brake. Using your right foot, practice raising engine revs to specific points (say 1000, then 1500). Try to hold a specific rev for 15 seconds or so. It's harder than you think! It's also not great to just go revving engines all the time like this, but again -- the finesse you'll learn from doing this exercise a few times is worth it.   Now you know the clutch engagement point for this car, and how to add a steady amount of gas. You can now practice again using both new pieces of knowledge -- this time, give it a bit of gas (raise the RPMs up to 1000 or so). Engage the clutch a bit faster than you did the first time (general rule is, the more gas you give it, the faster you can manipulate the clutch). This is where practice makes perfect. Try it a bunch of times -- get the car moving, stop, repeat. Once you feel pretty comfortable starting from 1st, you'll probably find shifting into higher gears is even easier.   People will tell you you need to manipulate the clutch super fast, and that's true to a point... But it's more important to learn how to finesse the clutch (don't move as fast as you can so much as moving with *purpose* if that makes sense).   Final tips: the clutch should always be fully up (with your foot off it), fully down to the floor, or in motion. Don't ""ride"" the clutch by keeping your foot on it and accidentally having it engaged a bit. You'll do more wear riding the clutch like that than you will finessing it like I discussed above. Also, if you have to keep the clutch engaged (to keep the car in neutral) for longer than 10 sec or do (say, at a stop light), consider taking the car out of gear and taking your foot off the clutch. This will ultimately save wear on your throwout bearing.   Hope this helps! Good luck :)",i got my WRX without any knowledge of how to drive stick luckily my old man taught me the basics but for the first few months i really regretted buying stick as i had trouble making smooth engagements and felt like i was destroying the clutch. but after a year im super glad i stuck with it its like second nature at this point dont worry it will come to you it just takes lots of practice,1

I like this one: https://www.sears.com/craftsman-230-piece-mechanic-s-tool-set/p-00999920000P# (also it's currently on sale)  &#x200B;  I like craftsman, they seem like a happy medium between cheap crap that breaks, and something nicer, but cost significantly more. Kobalt are probably fine, but I have no real experience with them. And frankly, my harbor freight stuff seems fine. Clearly a lower quality, but I haven't managed to break a socket yet.   &#x200B;  Go to harbor freight, and get the pittsburg jack (I like the low profile one, but that's because my car is lower)   &#x200B;  While you're there, buy whatever jack stands they've got on sale. They should all really be fine.  &#x200B;  Go to the auto parts store. Get a couple of oil catch pans (one for oil, one for other fluids). Also start keeping your clear plastic jugs instead of recycling them, so you have somewhere to put used oil.   &#x200B;  Funnels for filling fluids. Pick a couple of those up also (one for oil, one for other fluids)  &#x200B;  Nice to haves:  &#x200B;  If you value your time more than your money, get a small electric impact wrench, and some impact sockets. They cost more than basic hand tools, but they save a significant amount of time. I have 3, and I use 1 of them that does \~100 ft/lbs of torque 90+% of the time. For that, I'll let you do some research. I use Makita, but they aren't cheap. Something like a Ryobi might work just fine for you at significantly less cost.   &#x200B;  Penetrating fluid  &#x200B;  Oil filter sockets (can typically pick them up at the auto parts store for cheap) I like these much more than the generic strappy wrench thing.   &#x200B;  Find out if there's a brake pad separation tool, those are also nice to have so you don't have to just man handle the pistons.   &#x200B;  That's all I can think of off the top of my head from thinking about doing basic maintenance.   &#x200B;","I've been buying tools as I need them from Harbor Freight.

"Because CVTs are more efficient, i.e. the entire point of a hybrid.","The first gen Honda Insight came in a manual. There is no reason you can't, I just assume the majority of people that are interested in buying a hybrid prefer an automatic.",0
"Because CVTs are more efficient, i.e. the entire point of a hybrid.","It could be done, like it is in the Honda CR-Z.  Introducing a manual transmission changes what things are available for the control systems to work with, so with more technically sophisticated cars like a hybrid, they're generally not favorable to what the engineers are trying to achieve.",0
"They can, but Toyota has decided to use an ""eCVT"" transmittion on the Prius. Essentially, instead of using any common transmission type, they have the electric motor generators and the engine all connected to the belt that drives the wheels via a fixed gear ratio. No clutch, no torque converter, no different gears. Thus a manual gearbox wouldn't really make sense.    In fact, only one electric motor generator drives the wheels directly, the other motor generator sits on the engine's crankshaft and acts as a starter/alternator replacement. Also, there is no fixed connection between the wheels and the crankshaft at all, just a planetary gear that allows the engine to assist the propulsion of the car at higher speeds.","First, let's talk about what a transmission does.  It multiples torque.  That's all.  A gas engine has very little torque at low RPM, so we put in some gears to help it along.  Gas engines are also most efficient at only one RPM, so a transmission helps us stay in the efficient range.  Electric motors have max torque at 0 rpm (called stall torque).  So if designed properly, cars with electric motors don't need a transmission.  The Nissan Leaf, for example, has only one gear, all the time.  Of note: electric motors also produce max power in the middle of their RPM range.  So if you're driving with an electric motor and you want more power, sometimes you may actually want to reduce RPM to get it.  Totally counter-intuitive vs. a gas engine. Your typical driver would fuck up an electric motor pretty badly if given a manual transmission.  Now, there are two types of hybrids.   A series hybrid is the most efficient.  A gas engine is used only to generate electricity, and it always runs at its peak efficient RPM.  The electricity it generates powers an electric motor.  And as we said before, electric motors don't need a transmission at all.  A parallel hybrid (like the Prius) can draw power from both the electric motor and the gas engine.  The car's computer decides which mode to use when.  These cars often have a smaller electric motor, which perhaps could benefit from a transmission. But the power curve for an electric motor looks way different than for a gas engine.  So as a driver, you'd probably ask it to so stupid stuff with a manual transmission.  It can use say a CVT or just a single gear to be more efficient (and more powerful) than you.  The parallel hybrid will try to stay in series mode as much as possible.  But if the driver is asking for more power than the electric motor can provide, it will also send power directly to the drive line from the engine.  There are lots of ways to do this.  But in all cases, you've got two power sources with different power curves that are both turned on at once.  So again, while it may benefit from a manual transmission, the car can do this better (more efficiently, and probably more powerful) than you.",0

Ordinary highway driving uses so little power that it really doesn't make a difference if that power is coming from the front wheels or all wheels.  The only time I would say this matters is when comparing between AWD/FWD and RWD.  RWD makes the car inherently less stable and is more prone to unexpected oversteer under acceleration.

"It depends.   Hot and cold has a detrimental effect on oil. Thus, it's good to change your oil at the beginning of summer, and the beginning of winter. Even if you haven't driven *""enough miles""*  If you're running dino juice, I'd change your oil. If you're running full synthetic, it holds up quite a bit better than the old organic oil. It's probably not necessary with full synthetic, but changing it won't hurt anything except your bank account.","I would say it depends on a few things. It's all about contaminants in the oil, and the pH. If you run a conventional oil: yes. Change it every six months.   If you run a synthetic, you are good for up to a year between changes. However, if this truck mostly does city driving and lots of short stops, then you're back to a six month interval.  Your vehicle can't talk, but you CAN get a good idea of how healthy the engine is. There's a place called Blackstone that will analyze the oil, looking at the types of contaminants and the lubricity characteristics. They can even tell you things like if your air filter is insufficient or there's a crack in the intake plumbing based on what they see in the sample. They will also be able to tell you if you need to shorten or are able to lengthen the service interval. It's not expensive ($30-$40 IIRC), and all done through the mail. Not a bad idea if you seriously want to keep the vehicle as long as possible.",0
"It's fine. Change oil based on miles/ operating hours, not time.","Before your next oil change.  Get an oil analysis kit (I use Blackstone Labs).  They send you a kit, take a small sample and send it in, cost about $30.  It will tell you a few things such as the health of the engine and for your case how much protection in left in the oil.  The nice thing about this is it will relate to your exact car and conditions.    I've done this on a few cars, old and new.

The big problem with these sorts of duty cycles is that the oil never really gets warm enough. Oh, it lubricates just fine at the lower temperature, but combustion creates water, and that water accumulates in the oil and doesn't have a chance to boil off as it does with normal operation. Same problem occurs with cars only seeing short city trips.   If you remove your oil cap in the winter and see a milkshake-like grease, that's water emulsified in the oil.   So, if you need to do this long idle, get the car good & hot at least once a week. If your commute has you out on the highway for a 20 mile cruise, perfect. That'll do it too.",1

Cables got reversed and voila! I now have two customers instead of one. There is a very important set of details when jumpstarting that may seem insignificant..  There will be people here who will laugh and scoff at my saying so. Learn how to jump start a car (from a ASE certified mechanic)- before buying cables. And don't go cheap. Good cables should be heavy and cost more than $20.  Road flares? Emergency signs (CALL POLICE)? Emergency blankets? Glass breaker? Seatbelt cutter? These are always kept in the trunk. If you splash down in a river, is that glass breaker or belt cutter helping you?  Most of this is just reasonable thinking ahead. Your parents might put $1000 worth of emergency kits in your car, but the odds that you'll need it are slender.  Ask your insurance provider about a premium road side assistance program.   In the event of a wreck, use your RA program to get a wrecker and SAVE BIG MONEY. The police are NOT REQUIRED to force the ""next scheduled rotation"" upon you. This is still a free capitalism based economy and if you have a tow provider FUCKING TELL THE OFFICER.  (sore subject)   If the police call your tow truck, the also usually regulate the cost of tow and daily storage because of competition. Be prepared to provide your own company and make the officer aware.  Keep it between the ditches, don't text, and don't race, I don't care if you think you can win.  Edit: most of the examples I make are aimed at the general public or broad spectrum and not specifically at you OP.",0

"Kinda sorta. A well known brand will typically be of better quality, and last longer, be better in not good conditions (rain, snow etc). There’s also the factor of performance. If you just want tires that work, brand isn’t too important imo.","I hate to complicate things for you, but it isn't which brand is better, but which tire is better.  Michelin, in my opinion, is my go-to brand, but even they have their good tires and terrible tires.  You really have to do more research if you want the best tire for your money.  Tire rack has great reviews (both from employees and customers) which I've used as a good go-by in the past.  Here are the ratings for Grand Touring All Seasons (probably the category you're looking at):  https://www.tirerack.com/tires/surveyresults/surveydisplay.jsp?type=GTAS",0
"There's a lot of information in this sub, most of it good, but based on your post I feel like it may be overwhelming. I'm gonna try and give you a minimalist/general set of info to consider.   **Don't *ask* the tire shop guys, *tell* them what tires you want.**The tire shop guys serve the interest of the store. They prioritize their own overhead and sales goals. Ignore any promotions or offers that do not apply to the tires you have already selected.   **Factory tires are your basis of comparison.** The tires the factory put on your car new are your minimum values. Tire rack is a great tool for this, it will tell you what your car came with and then parse out other options so you can compare different values.  **Buy in the middle of the road.** The business model of the cheapest of the cheap tires isn't built around the performance or longevity of the tire, its built around someone who can't *not* get a tire. At the other end of the spectrum the most expensive tires are mostly for bragging rights among enthusiasts.  **All-Seasons are *fine*.** Between *""mild climate""* and the occasional use of traction aids, you don't want summer tires, and you probably don't need much ""wet"" traction. A well reviewed all-season is all you need.  For more specific information you can always let us know what part of the world your in and what you're driving.",Stick with one of the major manufacturers. Other than that it’s pretty much a trade off between life of the tire and performance of the tire. Stickier tires won’t last as long as harder tires but will grip the road better. Pick one within reason as a good balance. Road noise can also be a consideration.,1

"Quality of components including crank, conrods, pistons etc.","Bore creates additional piston mass, but stroke increases piston speed. The latter has a greater effect on rev limit than the former.    This does not take into account the valve train, though. Without upgrade, there's risk of valve float, as well as valve or spring fatigue.    Generally speaking, if you want higher RPMs, you'll maintain stroke, but replace the rotating assembly with more-stout forged pieces. You'll also be looking at aftermarket cams, valve springs, retainers, and potentially the valves themselves.    However, the thing that could be the biggest issue is one that's often forgotten: oiling. Spinning a factory oil pump gear set faster than it was designed for can often lead to starvation, cavitation, or fatigue issues.    Extra RPMs are hard (and potentially expensive) to achieve, with few exceptions (e.g. Honda.)

"quarter-ton is really just a class rating nowadays, if you look in the driver's door jamb there should be a plaque with a gross vehicle weight rating.",Depends on the load rating of the vehicle. Modern trucks just use that to describe the size of the truck in general. Its kinda dumb.,1
Galipogos mentioned the military rating which the ton ratings were original. A two and a half ton military truck is a beast that could easily carry ten tons. The thing is the military ratings were set to what a truck could safely carry up a 100% grade (45 degrees). This is a very tough standard.,"I'm not going to reiterate what others have said, but I will tune in about the hatchbacks. That's another one to check the door jamb for the weight capacity because at 1000lbs you were pretty likely overloading it. Just because it's handled it a few times doesn't mean it isn't wearing the suspension and drivetrain drastically faster. For example I have a small hatchback that has a weight limit of 650lbs with passengers and cargo. I've overloaded that on plenty of occasions, especially packing it to the roof for camping trips. *But* my suspension was beyond shot at like 75k miles. My coils were worn out so I would scrape on speed bumps or little dips in the road and my shocks and bushings were blown out, so it had a terrible ride. You may not see a difference while your overloading it unless a part decides to give out in the act, but eventually it'll bite you in the ass.  In terms of the engine, it can also handle it, but you're probably just prematurely wearing it or it'll be fine. The bigger concern is the transmission. Pulling hills with an overloaded vehicle puts a ton of strain on the transmission and transfers a lot of the heat from an overworked engine straight to it.",1

"The front suspension of a Jeep Wrangler has had something vaguely like this for about 25 years.  The Jeep Cherokee was like this for a long time too.  4x4 Ford and Dodge pickups were like this for a long time (and may still be).  The only difference is they have 2 arms on each side, and put a spring & shock above the axle, but the arms swing forward like that.    With a lot of work, you could probably put all the springs inboard on the other end of the swing arms, but it would put all of those parts in the place where the people generally go, and leave all of that space open in the front where the engine/suspension usually goes, so I'm not sure there's much incentive to do that.","Some highly articulated rock crawlers have suspensions like this.

"On a subaru specifically, you can have some AWD interaction while the car is in neutral.   The Subaru AWD system operates on a viscous coupling center differential in the tail shaft of the transmission. this is trying to keep all wheels turning the same speed. In most manual variants of the transmission (DCCD excluded), this is a dumb viscous coupling that's tied to the output shaft to connect the front and rear wheels.      If the differences between front and rear wheel speed vary too much, this will generate heat within the fluid, causing changes in viscosity and thus friction, to try and keep wheels spinning at the same rate.      Now, in your cited use case, it really won't have any impact, because AWD doesn't offer much to any benefit in power-off situations. AWD is more about putting power down (accelerating) in poor traction situations. Because you haven't applied any power, the wheels will be as close to free-wheeling as they can be.",Neutral = no wheel drive,1

But parking over tall grass DOES encourage mice, so that's a thing to avoid.",0
"There is not really a simple answer this this question, as it's not as simple as safe or unsafe. So lets think about what the risk factors are  and you can make your own choices from there.   So what are we worried about when parking over leaves? Simple: Fire. We don't want our vehicles going up in flames as that is super inconvenient.   So why would a fire start under your car when parking on leaves? Well that is simple too: The hot surfaces under your vehicle, primary your exhaust, could potentially ignite a few leaves. This fire could then rapidly spread and ultimately lead to you having a very bad day.   With this in mind, what factors would make a day ruining fire under your vehicle more likely? I can think of two:  1) The volume or height of leaves that you are parked on. Are the leaves likely to contact the hot parts of your car if you park on them? If you are plowing the leaves with your bumper in order to park, then probably. If you are not plowing leaves then the risk is lower. Note that lower risk does not equal no risk. Always use your best judgement.   2) The moisture content of the leaves. If the leaves are dry, then they are pretty much begging to be set on fire. If its been raining and the leaves are damp or soaked, then there is much lower risk of them igniting.   When it comes to the necessity of parking on the street when there are lots of leaves, I keep the two factors above in mind. If there are huge piles of dry leaves, I am not going to park there. If there is a small pile of dry leaves, I'm not going to worry.   Hopefully this helps! Stay safe out there and remember to keep your stick on the ice.","If we're just talking about a handful of errant leaves in the street, then no, you don't have to worry about leaves getting ""in"" under your car. The underside is absolutely painted in all of the worst things you can imagine, contact with a leaf or two isn't going to make much difference.   But if we're talking about *a lot* of leaves, especially dry leaves, they're an excellent fire starter, so consider parking somewhere else.",1

Do some cost/benefit analysis on the situation and that'll pretty much make your decision to fix/not to fix for you.  If your truck doesn't have rust on the frame, it's worth some money.

We flat towed a broken down $200 car back to my house and I just kinda figured it out as I went. $800, a few months of not knowing what the hell I was doing and a few mistakes later and I had a running project car.  In your case, a 1991 Honda of that vintage could very well be had for the ballpark of $1000 in running shape. It is an older Japanese car, so there could be some kinks to work out, but for a high schooler, the car would be perfectly usable and reliable honestly.   Save up anyway you can, and while doing so, constantly check nearby for listings within your price range and when you can afford it, pull the trigger. This gives you the perfect chance to kickstart basic maintenance. Buying a used car means you should perform the usual stuff, a great stepping stone.  Oil change, coolant flush, brake flush, serpentine belt and possibly brakes. Check the forums and  every YouTube video you can (older Honda's have such a rabid following you'll get at least a 1000 videos and millions of forum postings about every repair ever) to learn how to do it all. Slowly, but surely it'll all just kinda start falling into place.  And trust me, you're not the only broke high schooler/college kid doing car stuff on a very limited budget, I'm in college and have very little to spare on my project, but we just make it work.  Ask your friends for tools or assistance or a place to work, as a car guy, nothing is better than a Saturday hanging with a couple of friends just ripping a car apart.

Car shows, car meets, season openers for the car season..  Since you already know what car you want to get... do some digging. Problems that came with the car/known with the car. Google/youtube how to fix those problems. Google those problems and google more. Get yourself familiar with the car, the problems and how people tend to fix those problems. Google pictures of the engine and try spotting some areas..

You're going to have to start from the bottom and work your way up.   You want a Honda so you're already ahead as far as cheap, easy to learn how to work on and plentiful goes.  1.

"As someone who lives in a very mountainous region with frequent heavy snowfalls with a long commute, AWD vehicles are worth their weight in gold in my opinion. Especially newer AWD vehicles that come with advanced traction and stability controls. As far as traction goes you will have piece of mind every time you go to pull into traffic on a snow covered road that your vehicle will actually move and not just spin. You will have considerably more stability at speed on snow covered highways, or going up hills with the traction and stability control systems.   With all that being said the one thing that an AWD will have issues with just like all vehicles, is stopping. Yes the stability and traction systems will help some with stopping, but not like studded tires or chains will.   If you take a AWD and put chains, or studded tires on it, you will pretty much have a giant snowmobile.","AWD is always nice to have, but “need” is a strong word.

No problem whatsoever. The only way to damage a vehicle overnight is to set it on fire and let it burn; there's almost no way to damage an automatic transmission via the controls in the car. I've only ever broken a trans when putting 500+ ft/lbs of torque through it.,Running or off?,1
That's pretty much was a turbo does (minus the purity of the air). NoS I'm pretty sure increases the amount of oxygen in the combustion or it allows the existing oxygen to burn better,"http://www.nitrous.info/oxygen-instead-nitrous-oxide.htm  Basically it's impractical because the N2O becomes a liquid when it's compressed and O2 doesn't.   The N2O cools the incoming air down as it's injected whereas O2 would just take the place of the incoming air.   The N2O cools the air inside the combustion chamber by way of the nitrogen absorbing heat, where O2 doesn't and that leads to serious detonation.   And also since nitrogen doesn't burn it also can absorb the heat after combustion, whereas O2 wouldn't and would lead to melting.   Edit-Changed NO2 to N2O",0

I was looking for a car for 6 months, and finally settled on a 2007 Dodge Caravan, because it had minimal rust and ""only"" 185k miles. But the whole front end needs to be rebuilt. Suspension, tie rod ends, struts, brakes, engine and transmission mounts, sway bar links and bushings. All need replaced. I would've known this if I had taken it to a mechanic, but after 6 months of people refusing to let me do so with any car I was interested in, I'd grown tired of the process. Lesson learned.  I would strongly recommend buying from a dealership. Sometimes they have cheaper used cars, sometimes they don't. At the very least, your $7.5k could be a down payment on a used car from a dealership. Dealerships usually don't give you any shit about getting the car checked by a mechanic, so you can have peace of mind going into the transaction. That being said, the key word there is ""usually"". Always remember to either walk away if they won't let you get it checked, ***OR*** leave room in your budget for repairs. In my case, the front end work on my van comes out to about $2.5k, and aside from engine and transmission replacement, front end work is some of the most expensive you can do on a car. So I'd say leave about $3k in your budget for potential repairs, if you decide to forego the mechanic check.",0
I’ve only ever bought used. Debt is the worst thing you can do right now. The rich are bleeding the poor dry and it’s only going to get worse,"I wouldn't ever finance a car or motorcycle I don't have enough money to pay off right away.  It depreciates the moment you sign for it, but you're on the hook for the duration of the loan. Plus too many things can happen to your car/motorcycle which can cause it to be a complete loss but you would still owe on the car.  If you HAVE to get a loan on a car, make sure you look into gap insurance so you'd be covered for the depreciation of the car.",1

I’ve only ever bought used. Debt is the worst thing you can do right now. The rich are bleeding the poor dry and it’s only going to get worse,"Paying outright is almost always a better idea, especially while you’re young and don’t have a lot of debt. Never buy anything, wether it be a loan or a car, on money/income you don’t have yet, because that can always fall through.  As for cars, Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic’s are both great options to look at right now, although the Corolla will be more pricey; Toyota’s seem to be over priced more so than the rest on the market. If you’re willing to learn how to drive manual, if you don’t know how to already, then I would challenge you to find one that is manual. They cheaper, more reliable, and easier to work on making maintenance costs lower.  If you’re willing to learn, doing all of your own maintenance is probably the best investment, not only in yourself, but in your car, that you could make. You save a lot of money on labor this way, and if you find a car easy enough to work on then you save a lot of heart ache. Honestly, an old-ish truck is not a bad option if you’re willing to learn to work on your own cars. They’re very easy to work on, lots more room to work, parts are much cheaper, and they’re very versatile.",1

Also picture a car with a higher/ or wider front than in back… retarded.,"Cars go forward most of the time. Air is in front of the car. The air must move. The less it moves and the more smoothly it moves (ie with laminar rather than turbulent flow) the less energy the car must expend. Starting low and ending high helps facilitate smooth air movement.  Drivers sit in the driver's seat. The lower the front of the car is in relation to the driver's seat, the smaller the blind spot is for the driver. Not being able to see what's in front of the car is bad.",1

"Others have mentioned downforce but also, the Maserati's designed to be driven hard and fast, it needs to keep its 621bhp engine cool when under sustained load, along with brakes, transmission, etc. The 100bhp petrol engine in your Lexus would *probably* be fine doing a few laps but temperatures would start to creep up and the brakes would begin to fade. That means there's a lot more air that needs to be channeled to the right places and put through draggy radiators in the Maserati.","As both other current answers say - downforce (spoilers, fins, dams, and other aero / cooling ducts etc.) create drag.  The other factor that's often overlooked is that Cd is a measurement of the slipperyness of the basic *shape*, you then **multiply it by the frontal area** (actual size of the shape) of the vehicle to get the total drag.  This is why some very large/ungainly vehicles have low Cd compared to sleek sports cars - they're not really seeing lower air resistance in real life, because the front of a VW bus is many times larger than a Jaguar e-Type (random example off the top of my head).",0

You can also ask to get a Pre-Purchase Inspection done by a mechanic local to the car,"We bought our last six cars out of state. Each time I flew out with a cashiers check or wired funds to close.  At the dealer I did need to sign documents, present ID, do a short drive and walk-around (previously, on-line, I did the title search and VIN look up at the manufacturer's website is available).  I'm sure that all of this could be replaced using overnight mail and a Notary.  They overnight you the documents.

The cost is probably a little less than the shipping and you see it up close before the purchase.  It can be a fun drive home. * I would not do either with a private seller - far too many scammers and non-dealers have no reputation to uphold or research. * Usually, if you pick it up you must pay that state's sales tax and save the receipt to show your home state.  If you paid less than your home tax they will charge to the difference. If you paid more then usually nothing more is due. * if you pick it up ask the dealer if the car will have a plate on it.

I've heard of people throwing kitty litter or something similar in the back to suck up moisture,"Disclaimer- I’m not a mechanic, but I like to work on my own cars.   It sounds like warm coolant is not getting through the heater core. The heater core is like a mini radiator located in the cabin under the dashboard on the passenger side that is supposed to circulate warm engine coolant. When coolant circulates through this “radiator” and air blows over it, it’s warming the air in the cabin. So, perhaps your Jeep is not circulating the warm coolant OR the coolant is not getting warm enough to heat the cabin.   Here is what I would troubleshoot:  1. Open the hood When the vehicle engine is cold, open the radiator cap and make sure you can see coolant. Low coolant could prevent the warm coolant from circulating through the heater core.  Add coolant if it’s low, or in a pinch at least add water and fill the reservoir to the proper fill mark. Close the cap.   2. Open the hood and Start the Jeep with the hood open and put your hand on the coolant hose, being very careful to stay away from moving parts, belts spinning and the radiator fan. Try to feel if there is pressure in the hose or even possibly can feel the coolant pumping through it. If the engine is cold the coolant should not flow through the engine until it reaches a certain warm temperature. If coolant is already flowing, make a note of that.   3. Let the engine run for 10 minutes or so until the engine is warming. Put your hand on the coolant hose again.  Is it warmer now or even hot to the touch? It should be very warm. Now find two rubber hoses running straight back towards the cabin.  These are the hoses that circulate hot coolant through the heater core. Are both smaller hoses hot/warm? If one is hot and one is cold, the heater core is blocked and the hot coolant is not circulating through the heater core. If this is the case, this could possibly be fixed with a coolant do flush and refill. If the core has to be replaced, that’s a job for a pro.   4. Are both or all of the hoses not very warm at all? Then the engine thermostat may be stuck open. The thermostat opens when the engine gets hot and routes coolant through the radiator, where it can cool off, then when the coolant is cool enough the thermostat closes and the engine circulates coolant in a closed loop and the coolant get hot again. This is how the engine stays at its ideal temperature. When the thermostat is stuck open, the coolant continues to circulate through the radiator and never really gets hot enough for you to feel warmth in the cabin. If this is the case, tapping the thermostat after you turn off the vehicle may unstick it, you may get lucky.  Changing the thermostat is a pretty big job in that the coolant needs to be drained, disposed of properly, refilled and purged of air.   Checking the coolant level and tapping the thermostat are easy and free, I hope one of those solves your problem.  Next, a coolant flush and fill could help with flow through the core, but I would check the thermostat also while doing that. The good news is you can drive with the thermostat stuck open. Your engine just stays cooler than optimum temperature.",0
Try tirerack,"Shaking in your tires isn't usually caused by bad tires as much as just unbalanced tires. If your tires still have plenty of tread on them, then I'd recommend taking it to a shop and getting your tires balanced. If you are still getting a lot of shaking then you have some other issues in your suspension.  If you do need to actually buy new tires just look at a site like tire rack or tire buyer. Your Accord doesn't need super nice tires so get something less than $100 / tire. Get new tire though. I used to buy used tires and it was a waste of money. You're just getting the take offs from somebody else who needed new tires.      If you buy through a site like tire rack or tire buyer then you can get an estimate for install when you purchase. Most places should give you a very accurate estimate so you know how much money you need to spend.",0
"Definitely buy new tires. Really the only time I can recommend buying a used tires is if you only need *one* to last you a short time before replacing *all*, preferably as a spare.  Anyway, the most practical way to do this, is to find your tire size, it will be on the side of your tire and will read something like 205/65/15. The numbers themselves may be different but whatever those numbers are, *that* is your tire size. You should also decide what *type* of tire you need, which will depend on the climate and type of driving you do.   * If you live in a hot dry place that never gets rain, you can get ""Summer"" tires. Though All-Seasons are fine too.  * If you get some to a lot of rain, I would get wet/dry all season tires.  * If you ever have to or plan to drive in snow, get M+S (mud & snow) rated all-season tires.  * If you have hard frozen winters, consider a second set of wheels with dedicated Winter tires.   With that information you can start shopping around for tires, by talking to different tire shops in your area. You should know these places employ salesman, whose job it is to upsell you. Don't take it personally, but be prepared to decline their amazing deals on amazing tires you probably don't need. But do keep an ear out for other promotions. Usually you can find one or more shops doing free install, or free alignments, or buy three get a fourth tire free etc etc. These can be good deals.   Alternatively you can shop for the tires themselves online, and occasionally find a good deal that way. But bare in mind online prices rarely include the cost of disposing your old tires or installing and balancing your new tires. Something to consider.",Try tirerack,1
Try tirerack,"What others are saying here about your suspension being loose, or bearings being worn, I'd add, alignment might be off -- start there.  The reason your tires are worn can actually be related to bad bearings.  If you're not up to the task of checking the bearings and suspension, find someone who is first.  The reason: You buy new tires, the car still shakes and now you're damaging the new tires you bought looking for a reputable mechanic to fix the real issue that got you in the situation -- this isn't a good spot to be in at all.  After clearing up any doubts about the suspension/bearings:  IMHO start with tirerack.com -- they have the absolute best tire comparison tool I've ever seen.   Note: I have no affiliation with them at all.   I have bought a lot from them over the years and haven't found a comparable site out there.  You enter the specifics about your car and it should come up with the stock tire size -- go and look at the tire size on your car (others in this thread have described the size specification well, and tire rack has a good guide on their site as to how to read them if you want more).   Check to make sure you're ordering the right tires.  BTW: it's entirely possible with a car as old as yours that someone put the wrong tires on it -- I'd trust tire rack over the tire size you have if the wheel size is correct and you don't have after-market rims.  I've seen this first-hand helping a relative with their tires -- the tire size was really off and since we were only buying 2 tires for the car, we ended up sticking with the wrong size -- but you're likely doing them all, so get them right if you can.  Next, figure out what you're going to be driving through the most.   Are you driving through snow a good portion of the year?  Are you buying tires to take the thing track racing?   Do you like tires that wear a long time vs sticky tires (performance or all-around ""all season"" tires)?     If you live in a temperate zone with snow a good portion of the year you should consider a good set of all season tires, for example.   If you live in the southwest where it's warm all year round you might want good summer tires.  If you just want tire longevity, pay more attention to the tread life rating of the tires.   The nice thing about tire rack is that people rate tires and you can find people that have bought exactly the tire you're looking at, commenting in the ratings about how well it worked for them.  You can sort by price and so on -- take some time and narrow the search to a couple or so tires.   You will get an idea of fair price for the tires.  As /u/arroyobass indicates, you have to account for what it costs to get rid of your old tires (it's been a while, but I think I paid like 10 bucks a tire last time).   You have to pay mounting and balancing on top of the purchase price.    This varies based upon the fee charged by tire installer/retailer.  Speaking of which, tire rack will drop ship to installers all over the country (likely near you) -- you don't have to have them ship them to you in other words.   I use a couple of installers in my area and they just receive the tires and I drive my car over and they put them on the car -- just like they would tires they sold me.     At this point you might opt out of not buying the tires at all from tire rack -- you're armed with a fair price for the tires themselves, and you are ready to call a couple of reputable dealers in your area.  I use the ratings on google maps for some ideas of who's good and bad (bear in mind, ratings can be ""cooked"", but it's all you have unless you know someone who can recommend a reputable tire sales place).  Call in, tell them the exact size of tire you are looking for and mention the *exact* tire you chose as your top choice on tire rack -- or the top couple.   ""I'm looking at a set of Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires 245/45 R17 -- what do you have like this or similar?""  They should give you a similar price.   It might be a good 20-30% higher.  They likely won't be able to the the tire brand you're looking at, but should suggest a comparable tire.    Be aware it's possible that they they suggest a tire that's not similar to the one you're interested in.  Example: you pick an all-season tire and they quote you a summer tire as a competitive suggestion.  Clarify by asking ""Is that a good all-season tire"", etc.    If you get prices that are way out of line, like double, for a couple of  different choices, I'd politely get off the phone and call another dealer.   People out there will pay way too much IMHO for tires and have literally no idea, and some tire places simply start the conversation with these insane prices to see if you're going to bite.      Anyway, the main point I'm driving at here, at least you're armed with some decent information as to what the tires cost and you are going to have some idea if you're being fleeced.   While you do have a tire salesperson on the line it's a great time to ask mounting and balancing questions, and tire disposal fees.    Ask what an alignment costs while you're at it, and how long it's good for (from my experience, some places will allow you to get it re-checked / reset in a certain window, like 6 months after getting the car aligned there).  You might find from talking to the salesperson that the tires are still a lot more than they are on-line, at which point you're hesitant to buy -- say something like ""Ok, thanks for the quote.   I'm going to have to think about this -- do you get a commission?""   This is a polite way of asking the salesperson if they're going to lose the sale to someone else if you hang up and call back.  They're not going to want to lose the sale to someone else, usually, and it's a great way to get them to think about this -- about half the time I do this they ask ""Do you have a competitive price in mind"" or something equivalent, at which point you can simply say ""I found X tire on-line in this exact size for Y amount of dollars"", which gives them a chance to give you a close to matching price.   I can't count the number of times that this has brought the price down for me (not just for tires).     Usually you're still over by a couple of percentage points -- sometimes you're less.   In any case, they're dipping into their margin to match the price, which is simply good business.  Buy the tires from them IMHO, they're willing to work with you and I'd rather give my business to a person/business that I can shake hands with if at all possible.     Consider having your alignment checked at the same time the tires are installed.  The only exception to this: you had your alignment checked/fixed a few days before.  Most places will check it for free and if it needs a correction they'll charge you then -- a reputable place isn't going to change the alignment is what I'm driving at, unless you need it.  This last bit pertains to the situation where you ended up buying the tires on-line -- I myself tip the guy who put the tires on the car -- usually $20.  This is not at all necessary, but because I bought the tires on-line and the store didn't make as much dough, I'd rather pass something to the guy at the end of the food chain.   This is, of course, if they treated me well (like any normal customer) and the job looks good.   Totally up to you.  Sorry about the wall of text but it sounds like you're looking for advice like this ;)  Cheers",0

Be prepared to walk at any moment if it doesn't feel right.","It highly depends on the circumstances. In some cases, accidents only do minor body damage. Technically hitting a dear is an accident, but is usually claimed on insurance.   The biggest issues from accidents are that the radiator could have got busted and the person is not mechanically inclined, and they overheat the motor, ruining it by warping it. That motor will probably blow gaskets like crazy, and will cost you dearly.   Another source of concern is the frame. If the frame gets even slightly bent, you lose a lot of gas mileage, and the car will eat through tires, because it will be crooked. It will be hard to get an alignment, and even if you do it will probably be a bad one, and the car will drift to the side unless you fight it by counter steering slightly.   If a car has a unibody(no frame) then it’s nearly impossible to tell if it’s bent, and any accident will pretty much ruin the car.   The best way to tell though, is to take it to a tire shop and let them put it on their machine, and inspect it. They will be able to tell you if the car is good or not atleast when it comes to the geometry of the frame. With the motor it’s a little harder to tell, you can get an idea by checking the fluids, and checking to see if the head has been removed. The best bet is not to buy a car that has been run hot. Especially cheap cars as the have almost pure aluminum blocks, and are easily damaged by even a little overheating.",1

In fact, get all hand tools here. A 1/2"" drive socket wrench and metric impact sockets (6 point variety, not 12, and make sure it includes a 15, 17, 19 & 21mm). More sockets in the 8-15mm range on a 3/8"" drive are good to have, too, so maybe one of their ""80 bazillion piece kits"" could be a good value.    Let's see, what else. A set of metric box wrenches. Two jack stands, and one of their floor jacks. A breaker bar to go with those 1/2"" impact sockets. Some sort of extra lighting is good. Don't bother with those wand shaped ones. Small handheld LED pucks work GREAT in wheel wells.   I WILL NOT MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ON THEIR ELECTRIC POWER TOOLS. I have no clue whether they're reliable or capable. Besides, an impact wrench can be traded for a little determination and lot of leverage.

If it's really invasive (like dropping the subframe), you may decide that it's more than you want to chew off. It may also help you decide your order of operations.

"Yea you'll be fine. Just make sure to take frequent breaks. And remember, DON'T FORCE ANYTHING. If something has to be forced, 9/10 you'll break something.","Alright my dude. Sorry not sorry for the wall of text:  Whether this is a good idea at all, one needs to ask what kind of a shed you've got. If you don't have a lot of tools, you're going to be looking at a $200-$300 outlay in tools. I mean, you'll always have them so future jobs will also be in your capabilities, but if getting the van running is a priority, it's something to consider.  If you were to do this work yourself EXCEPT the struts, do that first and then take the car in for the struts *and an alignment*. Doing the tie rods is likely to put your front toe out of whack, and it's advisable to get an alignment when the struts are replaced anyway.   A quick search at Rock Auto tells me that MOOG and Gabriel both sell replacement ""quick struts"" for the Caravan. They are the strut, spring & top hat assembly, ready to be installed with 5 bolts.   That reminds me, put a torque wrench on your tools list. I wouldn't its accuracy on cylinder head bolts, but the 1/2"" drive torque wrench at Harbor Freight is good enough for suspension work (remember to unwind it after use to keep its accuracy).

"Installing a duct in your hood may very well reduce cooling airflow through your radiator. Also, your engine gets very wet in the rain, if air can flow through your radiator water can too. As long as you're not dumping water on electronics or the air filter you'll be fine.","Rain isn't something you have to worry about--an engine bay regularly sees plenty of water splashes up from the bottom (or through the radiator). Just be sure that the immediate location is clear of electrical connectors.  However, most people interested in using airflow to their advantage will attempt to REMOVE air from the engine bay, not add it. By adding the NACA duct, you are adding a pressurized stream of air into the engine bay. With a higher under-hood air pressure, air will be less willing to flow through the radiator, possibly making the cooling issue worse, not better. Further, pressurized air in the engine bay increases front end lift at speed--where does the air go once it reaches the bay? The usual answer is ""under the car"", and that's no good for high speed stability (or drag / fuel economy).   Most people attempting to fix engine bay heat and high speed stability will resolve the issue by venting the hood at centers of low pressure.  Here's a good white paper about extracting heat & managing airflow:  https://racelouvers.com/content/Race-Louvers-Hood-Vent-Tech-Tips.pdf",0

Now i will say this. Accelerating in 5th gear at a very low rpm puts more strain on the crankshaft. Just something to keep in mind.",1
"Engine braking in the wrong gear can over rev your engine yes. And over revving will damage the engine.  Normally the rev limiter prevents the engine from over revving itself by cutting fuel however under engine braking the wheels and transmission are pushing the engine and cutting fuel does not stop the mechanical forces of the wheels speeding up your engine, and selecting the wrong gear can and will send it way past the redline.   Choose your gears carefully in a manual.   Some newer cars have lockouts to prevent this but many do not and the older the car the less likely it is to have a lockout so you can easily destroy your power train or engine by selecting a gear too low while moving too fast for that gear.   If your car has a carburetor then it’s definitely too old to have a lockout.    You need to know your car well enough to make sure to know the appropriate speed range of each gear.",In addition to what other people you can brake too hard and slip if the road is snowy or something and you drop gears too much,0
"It seems like the labor and parts from the last repair should still be under warranty.

"Do yourself a favor and make two brief internet searches. First, go to AutoZone/Kragen/Napa.com or whoever is closest to your house and look at what the most expensive options are for brake rotors and brake pads.  Now, go to rockauto.com and do the same search. After having done these two searches you will have a baseline idea for what the parts piece of the job should cost. Bear in mind, Kia isn't a brake rotor manufacturer and they aren't a brake pad manufacturer. If one set of pads on RockAuto are listed as OEM (original equipment manufacturer) then they are the company who made the part for your car when it was first manufactured. 99% of the time, that means they're exactly what KIA would sell you.  Now, you know what the parts to do a full brake job cost. For 99% of passenger cars, when using the most expensive option, this cost is about $500.   ANY idiot can successfully change a set of pads and rotors using a HarborFreight tool box, jack, and jack stands. Literally ANY idiot. Pick one. They can do it.  But maybe you just don't see yourself doing that sort of thing, that's fine. You're now armed with the knowledge to be able to read Yelp reviews and weed out the terrible shops, then have a frame of reference when you actually talk to the guy at the shop. If you know parts cost $500, they are saying the job will take a couple of hours, and they are quoting you $1,500, then you can make an informed choice. Should a brake mechanic make $500/hour? My dentist charges me $700/hour, and he is technically a doctor. ANY idiot could not be a dentist. A dentist has support staff, and even those folks couldn't be ANY idiot. Their salaries factor into that $700.  My point is this. In my area (NorCal) I'd expect a full brake job (discs and rotors, reuse old calipers) on a car with four wheel discs to cost about $750. They aren't going to spend $500 of that on parts. They'll spend $400 on parts and get you what the factory would have installed. The remaining $350 is what you pay for not having to do it yourself.   I will always argue that you should learn how to do anything yourself before you try to hire someone to do it (excluding dentistry). If you know how to do it, you know how to buy it. At the very least, you can prevent yourself from getting hosed.","It seems like the labor and parts from the last repair should still be under warranty.

Forget going down to Advanced Auto on a Saturday afternoon because you need an axle seal--it'll be lots of parts from the dealership. 2. That extends to the aftermarket. There's no budget aftermarket for suspension parts.  3. The rear brake design is miserable. See your rear e-brake issue. 4. The 6-speed manual transmission was not used in any other popular north american market car, and the synchros aren't great. Replacement transmissions are either expensive, or used, and likely to be suffering similar issues.

Otherwise pretty ordinary. * Land Rover Evoque convertible: it's a convertible crossover! (But also expensive and unreliable, so maybe forget this one.) * Acura ZDX: not quite a crossover, sort of a luxury hatchback with weird styling. * Cadillac CTS wagon: aside from the fact that wagons are endangered, this one has styling unlike anything else. * Chevrolet SSR: just your average convertible pickup car. * Isuzu Vehicross: it hasn't been sold in almost 20 years, but you'd be hard presssed to find a weirder looking little off-roader.

"-BMW i3  -Any of the importable Kei cars, if legal in your locale","A Bricklin SV-1. It's one of the very few cars developed in Canada, has a very sporty look, but was almost entirely designed to be an ultra safe car (by 70s standards) which is why the SV stands for Safety Vehicle.   It actually looked pretty cool and wasn't terrible on performance (it wasn't great either). One of the more eye catching parts about it is the pneumatically powered doors that opened up like a Deloreon. So think Deloreon doors except you just press a button instead of doing the hard work of lifting it yourself.   Biggest bonus: it was actually reliable because the company sourced AMC and Ford motors for the car, both of which were some of the more reliable engines from each company at the time. The doors were it's known failure points, however.  here's an article on it  It's almost a guarantee non car people will know nothing about it, and it's still kinda likely a car person won't have heard of it or barely know of it",0

There is a very slight grade in the street in front of the house I lived in when I got my first manual transmission car. Basically if you left the car in neutral it would roll backward slowly.   I started by being on that grade and playing with the clutch/throttle ratios until I could hold the car still without using the brake. At that point I was able to easily and smoothly accelerate the car basically whenever I wanted.   This was a 2001 Acura Integra GS-R that had about 30 miles on it so the clutch was new. Not sure if that mattered. Regardless - it worked for me.,Slow down the clutch release. Slow shifts equals smoother shift. Its not like the movies where they shift all crazy and fast.,0
"The best answer I can give is it really depends where you are and that areas light pattern.  Back where I grew up you would have a good 2-3 seconds between when the light turns red for you and when the light turns green for opposing traffic.

If I'm uncertain whether I can stop safely or not, I proceed.  If I'd have to accelerate to make it before the light turns red, I stop, unless stopping would cause some idiot tailgating me to hit me. This is rare, but happens.  I like being in the font when the light turns green. I like being able to see ahead.

"If I'm uncertain at my current speed, I will check to see if there's anyone behind me and how far away they are...depending on how fast I'm going also I can generally judge how long a yellow will last relative to where I am and either brake to a stop or continue through it, speeding up a little if needed.  If it's raining or the ground is even slightly slick I'll usually just go through it.

That being said, I'd only recommend it if you are handy with cars, because stuff will break down, that's not a question.

There's even an online store where you can get all the really niche, hard to find bits for the car. Online support is plentiful for this car, you're never going to fall short with help.  I can't say much about the Cooper S, I'm not really a BMW fan, but I can imagine you'll be able to toss it around with a bit more aggression and speed.

"So, I'm not gonna talk about worth it or not. What I'm going to talk about instead, is what you can do and what you absolutely must not do yourself. Simple, no? The decision of whether or not a 242DL is worth getting back to running is like any vehicle, highly subjective.  > Ignition control module  Disconnect old one, connect new one. How hard this is, I don't know as I'm unfamiliar with the location. It's USUALLY pretty easy though.  > Hall effect switch in distributor  Can you operate a screw driver? Can you follow very simple directions, such as ""line up the wires""? Then you definitely can handle this. Note: sometimes, you can install it backwards. This will not damage it.  > Distributor cap, rotors, wires, and plugs  Aside from the risk of breaking a plug, again, these are all low risk, easy driveway tasks. Just take basic precautions like photographing things with your phone (just in case) and it's a simple matter of plugging in largely fool-proof parts. Please do not cross thread the spark plugs. Finger thread them, finger tighten them, then use a proper spark plug socket.  > Fuel pump  This one is... well, let's just say that I would not do it at home. Sometimes the fuel pump is not a big deal. Sometimes, it is a really, REALLY big deal involving dropping the gas tank out of the car.  > Front caliper and hoses  This is an iffy one. You can do it yourself, yes. You can buy a brake bleed kit, sure. And you'll likely have problems down the road if not immediately if you haven't done it before. I'm not disparaging your mechanical inclination; I'm saying 'brakes are *kind of important* to not dying in your car. And even professional, ASE certified mechanics don't infrequently get surprise leaks and failures after doing this.'  > All vacuum hoses under hood  This is because of the rot. They're presumed bad. Some may be fine, but you should assume they're bad. Can you do it? Sure, if you can read Volvo vacuum diagrams. Is it a huge pain in the ass? **Oh god yes.** This one is entirely dependent on your tolerance for pain and how up to date your tetanus boosters are. You WILL bleed. Period.  > Inner tie rods left and right  This has to be done by a shop. Do not do this at home, if you do this at home you will probably die. I am not exaggerating. I am not using hyperbole. You are talking about a repair which requires you to do two things. One, have the front axle well off the ground. Two, make your alignment not even remotely right. Oh, and if you survive that but do something as small as overtorquing it or twisting it a bit too much, your steering will fail on the road and you will almost certainly die.","Is it worth getting it back on the road?

www.tirerack.com  They have a ton of wheels and really good software.  You can see what they'll look like before you put them on even.,"You *don't* need the same diameter wheel. You *do* need a tire that is as close to the original overall diameter as you can get. For example your current overall diameters are 25.09"" and 25.02"". So for example a 225/45/17 Front and a ~~225~~245/40/17 Rear would be nearly identical overall diameter in a smaller wheel. Depending on style and cost it's something to consider. You can find similar overall diameter tires for even smaller rims but I wouldn't recommend it as you might have to worry about clearing your brakes. You could also go even bigger but that usually has an adverse effect on ride quality.  The speedometer *will* be effected if the *overall* diameter is changed. The greater change in O.D. the greater effect on the speedo. However minimal changes are hardly noticeable, up to an inch I wouldn't really worry about it.  Next, the ""Right *amount* of bolt holes"", Is referring to PCD. Basically your cars bolt pattern is 5x112mm. So you need wheels that are also 5x112mm. Also your center bore (hub size) is 66.5mm. You can use a wheel with a larger center bore and hubcentric adapters, but you can't adapt to a smaller center bore, so bare that in mind.  Next, you need to consider offset or backspacing, depending on where you are in the world the terms vary. The stock rim is 18x7.5 ET37. Thats a +37mm offset so if you're shopping wheels and looking at offset it should be as close to +37 as you can get if you want it to stay close to stock.",1

Do some research. You need numbers, rims are about numbers. The diameter matters a lot if you want to use the same tires, make sure the width is close, usually aftermarket wheels are half an inch wider. The next important matter is bolt pattern. Not just how many lug bolts you have (lug nuts for you non-Mercedes owners), but the spacing of them. Usually a number like 5x1.25, 4x100, etc. Your new rims will not even bolt up if you don't get that right. Offset is also pretty important, because getting that wrong means they still won't bolt up because they hit the strut, or if they do they rub on everything when you turn. It can be fudged a bit, but if you're not looking for dished wheels or hellaflush then you'll want to keep it close to stock.",1

"> Regardless of how well you look after a car, some cars seem poorly engineered and will give you grief. Is this true?  That is true. Sorta.  Let's say the ""big failure rate"" of a a given vehicle is is particularly high. Maybe 25%. If you own one, you've got a 3-in-4 chance of having a perfectly happy experience for that first 100k miles or whatever. And one dude that says ""my car's been fine! the problems are all overblown"" is what we call ""anecdotal evidence"".   Your notion of outliers was correct. And unless you talk to enough owners, you won't really know the full story.  That's why I loved TrueDelta. Crowd-sourced vehicle reliability, sampling not just people with failures, but people with zero issues at all. It was an invaluable tool for like 10 years. A shame they've gone paywall for their data. I think a lot of people gave up on them after that. I know I did.","Keeping up with maintenance is very important, but it helps nothing if you use poor quality parts and oils. A shitty part will fail faster than a good one, obviously. It is the same with with cars. A Toyota engine is going to last longer than a BMW engine. This is because Toyota does far more reliability testing and focus their engineering efforts on reliability, while BMW, well doesn't. They use top quality components and prioritize quality over price.",1

So Toyotas, for example,  may have a 3% failure rate and the Buicks may have a 13% failure rate.","yes and a no, it will for the mechanical parts but wont for the fittings like interior or switches  example is BMW mini. EVERYTHING falls apart on them.   BMW = break my wallet. the reason is because of the absurdly high failure rate of the components due to bmw cheaping out on mechanical parts and the correct parts costing as much as the car. because a cheap german car is never cheap.  there is a reason i drive fords... despite what others will say: havent had to worry about anything but maintenance. and ive had multiple fords.",0
"Preventative maintenance is absolutely worth it especially if you can do it yourself - regular oil & filters will help prevent a lot of wear that will accelerate bigger problems.  Likewise keeping stuff clean, lubricated, rust-free, and replacing parts when they show signs of problems rather than when something fails catastrophically and does a load more damage because of it.  Some modern cars will live for 100k+ with total abuse and zero maintenance but that doesn't really mean much - some people eat junk, drink, and smoke and live to ripe old age but you know that's not a great way to live your life.","The difference between the top performing model and the next best is about 10 or 15%.

On the one hand you want to research any issues that your particular car might have, common failures are usually documented by TSBs or can be found on Consumer Reports online. On the other hand you should follow the maintenance schedule because you'll get more life out of your car and it will let you catch small problems before they become big. A failing ball joint is a lot cheaper to replace then all of the other steering components and body work that will get damaged when it fails.

Smart side: Shift into first unless at crawling speeds will always be a bad thing.   Serious: pending on what vehicle you are driving you shouldn't have to worry about downshifting when coming to a stop.  The vehicle will downshift and will start at 1st when you start accelerating from a stop.  Same for when you need to upshift the vehicle will always shift gears if it senses it's gonna hit the rev limit.    I've driven several automatics with a manual mode and all had downshifted when I was slowing to a stop.,Modern cars with manual mode won’t allow a shift if it will damage the engine.   It can be unsafe to drive due to the rapid deceleration that you experienced.,1
"That’s probably from the engine braking due to the jump in revs from shifting from 2nd to 1st too early.   Always better to shift down to 1st from 2nd when you’re definitely going to stop. Otherwise, driving it in 2nd is fine.",This is normal and expected.,1

Save money on other stuff, like buying the base model Rolls-Royce.  If you can't do it....  Yeah, rent a U-Haul box truck and tow the Tucson (probably best upon a tag-a-long trailer).  Allow yourself at least 3 days and take a week or two if you have the time.  Leave the Rockies for another time.  Be safe, not sorry.",U-haul itself is a great source for what you need to move.,1

"Coming from the BMW world (e36, e46, e9x) anything  I can, FCP Euro. Lifetime warranty on everything they sell, no questions asked (that includes oil, coolant, brake pads, whatever you might want). If it’s not FCP Euro parts (drift cars), it’s most likely something that is either custom made or made my a smaller company (like a bash bar from a local fab guy, tubular control arms from SLR, coilovers from Fortune, or bushings/mounts from Condor) I am always happy to reach out to them and let them know what went wrong. I don’t expect anything in return since they’re not warrantied parts but as someone who loves the fabrication process and supporting small business, I’m always looking to help them out. I fortunately have had just 1 issue with a small-business product, and it was one that I was “pre-production testing” (it was free), and that company was so happy I found an issue and could provide some info. Out of respect for their competitors who I don’t have experience with, I won’t name them... but small business is great.   Parts store warranties are great but I find myself using them often whenever I get stuck buying from a parts store. Quality there is lower in my experience than what you get elsewhere. Sure, you’ll get it replaced without issue, but for me it’s buy once cry once with posts that can derail a weekend at the track if they fail.","The good: Mishimoto honored their warranty on a radiator after I found a small leak.

This seems to be an ""every few years"" task as they gunk up again. We could hear the water sloshing around though, so it might not be the cause for you.",0

"Just to add a little to the other comments, one of the main functions of a fuse is to protect the wiring. The current a wire can carry depends on its size - large wires for high current, small wires for low current. Too much current will work, for a while, but the wire will get hot and could potentially start a fire. To prevent that happening, a fuse is fitted. If the circuit draws more current than the wire is capable of supplying, the fuse blows. If you put a larger fuse in then you take away that protection.  In any case, 15A at 12V is plenty for the kind of things most people want to plug in (phone charger or sat nav). If you're using something that does need more power then it needs to be wired in properly.",Listen to the engineers...,1

"In your car or home, the size of the wires on a circuit define the maximum amperage for that circuit's fuse or breaker.  Installing a higher rated breaker puts you at risk if the amperage draw exceeds the wire size.  In a home, a 15A breaker circuit is wired with #14 wire (or greater) and a 20A breaker is wired with #12 wire (which is larger than #14) or larger.  Yes, a circuit can work for years with a mismatched breaker, until it doesn't.","I mean you could, but you probably shouldn't. My grandpa would put nails instead of fuses on his Volvo Amazon when he was young but that was obviously not the right thing to do and the risk of a fire I creased drastically.  I've put higher amp fuses in my car, 1987 Saab 90, when they went because they were the only ones available. Then I switch back when I buy new ones.

"What's going to happen with lowering springs is that the car will feel more harsh (due to the higher spring rate) while also handling more poorly (because the springs are now over-matched for the shocks).  But it'll look lower.  Depending on how low you go and on the spring rates, you'll also need to be careful with either shock bottoming out, or coil bind, both of which have the potential to damage your car if they happen often.  Coil bind and shock bottoming are not a little bump - it's that feeling when you smash into a pothole or take a speedbump way too fast.  If you're going to go that route, a few things to consider:  \- If you're doing the work yourself (i.e. borrowing or renting a spring compressor), be careful.  \- If you only want to do lowering springs, check a forum dedicated to this car to find recommendations on length and spring rate, to avoid the above situations.  \- If a shop is doing the work, most of the cost is going to be labor.  So for an extra couple hundred bucks, you might be able to buy shocks matched to the springs to save the handling characteristics of the car.  Again a forum dedicated to this car might have recommendations for matched shocks and springs, as well as pictures of before/after.","I've known a lot of GTI owners, from MK4 on up to MK7, and without fail everyone who tried just installing springs ended up on either coilovers or bagging the car down the road.

Ebay coils/sleeves with stock type struts ride great in the top 50% of their adjustable ride height.  Pretty much stock spring rate imo.

Consider going cheaper, more milage and being under your budget. Beyond 75 is where things start to break and you will need to budget. If you go with a 5k vehicle, you'll have 3k 'saved' (and I use the loosely) for repairs.  Also budget 300 to have a third party mechanic to look at it.

"I agree with the other posters that you should probably look elsewhere. I'm not familiar with your used car market, but I don't think 8k is a great deal. Granted, if it's been immaculately kept, that could be a decent choice, the skyactiv models get pretty great mpg for their segment.  Personally though, I'd look for a Toyota Corolla. Cost of ownership is going to be lower than any Mazda, or even Honda. However, if they're readily available in your area, I really don't think you can beat a 2011 or newer Prius. NHSTA data bears out my personal experience that nothing serious (powetrain, i.e. engine, hybrid system, or transmission) ever goes wrong on these things. The 2010s can have engine issues at 200k+ miles, and the 2009 and previous are just not worth looking at, given how much worse they are than the 3rd gen (2010+) and your budget.  If possible, try to find one with service records from a dealership, but don't let that be a deal breaker if you find a good one that test drives well.  If you have a friend who owns a 3rd gen Prius, try to get them to test drive with you. If they're not totally ignorant of their vehicle and its idiosyncrasies, they'll be able to tell if something's off. The beautiful thing about the Prius is that they're so reliable, that what you see really is what you get in 99% of cases. If something is wrong, it will tell you on the dash, or an experienced Prius driver or mechanic will notice.

"Just a note, I never went through with an engine swap but researched it out and decided it wasn't worth the cost. I have a 99 Honda Civic EX, so around the early 2000s engine swaps were very common in the area (SF Bay Area). There were two ways of doing this, dirty (where if you get caught or need to do a smog check, you swap back the original engine), or the the legit way (getting the fabled CHP approval sticker). https://honda-tech.com/forums/attachments/vehicles-sale-42/134837d1275631881-1997-civic-ex-coupe-smog-legal-b18c1-swap-image016.jpg  The rules back then were the engine had to be the same year or newer to the car, doesn't matter if it's from the same car trim (Integra GSR can go into a Honda Civic DX). The problem with the generation I owned was the limited stock of newer engines on the used market, so it was (at the time) $5,000 for a complete swap including transmission if I wanted to go the legal route.   But this doesn't guarantee you that it's going to be legal, that's on the CHP inspection. Which I heard is very very difficult to pass, you need to have the entire smog system swapped over from the donor car and all of the plastics like the airbox back to the factory (some of this might be ok to have aftermarket but I heard it's very strict on the ruling).  I'm not sure how the rules are now but at the time there was a flux of Honda's and street racing so I'm sure the CHP would not allow many of these swaps to happen. Even worst was the market of stolen engines (hmm, why is the VIN tag ground off?).   If you are looking into the full detail of this from inside California, I would first look at your year, and find out if there's a large stock of spare engines. If it's something rare, the prices are $$$, also some times the ECU will not work with certain years so that's another thing to budget, or the wiring harness, ugh.

"Actually, NOS was a lot more prevalent much earlier than that. NASCAR fined a lot of drivers in the '70s for cheating with NOS. Back when engines used to be big iron blocks with iron heads, they could eat a 200 shot of nitrous pretty much completely stock and not bat an eye. It was the cheapest way to make big horsepower, especially for drag racing, for a long, long time.  Now, engines are built to a much more exacting standard, and are primarily aluminium. The era of massively overbuilt engines for stock applications has been gone for quite a while, because we can engineer reliability without drastically overbuilding tolerances (thanks, computers!) so you can't just jam a crapload of nitrous into an engine without everything blowing up anymore. You have to do a LOT more work to make an engine be able to withstand it, so it quickly became not worth it for stock cars/budget builds/discount drag racing.  People still use a lot of NOS, but it's primarily older cars (hot rodders still use it all the time) but no one is slapping a 150 shot onto a stock new car anymore because it just destroys itself if you do that.","movies made it popular. the only people running nitrous are drag racers, and most people just like turbos better.",1
Cheap ebay turbo kits probably are also to blame for this. Why spend money on extra power that's only good for a few seconds if you can just turbo it and get extra power that doesn't has to be refilled after every use?

The Prius uses and Atkinson cycle motor. This takes some of the gains from a turbo.   Turbos are precision parts that cost a considerable amount to produce in parts and labor.    Turbos increase maintenance expense.   In an already highly efficient motor the gains are not worth the input.,"I really dont know much about prius' but it might have to do with the fact the engine is used like a generator as well. It turns on and off when the batteries need topping off. You can leave the AC on all the time and it will start the engine when its running low. This type of on and off operation is not great for a turbo, it would probably end up with carbon buildup from idling for so long. And when idling it would actually reduce efficiency because of the extra restriction in the intake/exhaust when its not on boost (at idle).  Also could be packaging, there may not be room for a turbo manifold, turbo, intercooler and other parts in the engine bay.",1

"The Ram/Jeep ""mild"" hybrid systems do in fact replace the altenator with a beefed up one that also acts as the starer.","They are not designed to work as a motor and are not related to one other than having similar construction.

There used to be starter/generators used in the past, however those are extremely limited in power output for both starting and charging.    It is possible but would require a major redesign of the alternator itself as well as how it is connected to the engine and with all the manufacturers now going to build electrics and hybrids I doubt you will see it done on an ICE powered vehicle.

Either the service manager is not a mechanic and doesn't know cars, or the CX-5 is an unusual vehicle that has an oil level indicator as well as the usual oil pressure switch light, or the service manager is an outright liar.    I don't see an oil level light for the instrument panel:  http://www.mcx5.org/warning_indicator_lights-74.html    There is a light to indicate low oil pressure, and it usually turns on when the pressure drops to 10 PSI, which may be enough to protect the engine when it's idling and already warmed up, but the general rule is that an engine needs at least 10 PSI for every 1,000 RPM, and in normal driving the engine will get up to 4,000 RPM.     > His [GM] response came in less than five minutes with an apology, an agreement to reimburse for the oil change,    What about reimburse for a new engine?

"A little bit. The chemistry is the same as a flooded battery, but they're more durable to vibration and shock.  My only AGM experience is with the factory NA/NB Miata battery, which generally lasts up to 10 years if it's in a daily driver. But then a lot of them die early because people would park their Miatas over the winter without a tender and let the battery drain flat, which is just as bad for an AGM as it is for a flooded cell.  In this case Interstate's marketing materials call out the MTX-H8 as a replacement for factory AGM applications which tend to be luxury cars with really high dark current, cars with start/stop systems, etc. Stuff that really stresses a battery.

Near to our old house in Massachusetts, a work friend had bought a house that had a barn on the property. It was a large, traditional barn with a large (probably space for 10-14 vehicles in this aisle) center aisle and two smaller side aisles plus hay lofts.  It also had a cellar space. So, we examined the structure and it looked like it would hold a vehicle (Mercedes 380 SEC) and I parked it, disconnected the battery and left it for about 5 months.  In the spring I reconnected the battery and it did need a jump but started fine.  We did this for four years but I did take the battery home with me after year 1 and kept in a heated space.  We also eventually moved all of our furniture into the barn for almost a year as we moved to Santa Fe, bought a small business and built our new house.",0

"So many people misunderstand the purpose of performance brakes.  The purpose of upgraded brakes is not to make you stop shorter; it's to prevent brake fade at a track.  You can only stop as fast as the laws of physics will allow.  In *every* modern car, right down to the cheapest shit box, the tires are the deciding factor in determining stopping distance, not brakes.  The reason is simple: Under normal street driving conditions, brakes are always capable of demanding more stopping grip from the tires than they can provide.  Skidding is the enemy of stopping power.  When a tire skids, it actually experiences significantly *less* friction with the pavement, resulting in significantly worse braking performance.  So, considering that stock brakes are capable of locking up the tires, you already have brakes that are demanding the absolute most stopping power from your tires.  All of the big brake kits and their various components are designed to avoid brake fade, not make you stop faster.  Brake fade happens when braking components get too hot, and the friction between the pad and rotor is reduced due to issues like glazing.  Calipers with more pistons can accommodate larger brake pads that absorb heat more slowly and avoid glazing on track.  They don't change the pedal feel or stopping distance.  You should never be in a situation on public roads where brake fade is occurring.  If that's happening you either have a stuck caliper, are riding your brakes, or are driving like an absolute maniac and need to take it to the track before you kill yourself and others.  What *does* affect pedal feel is the age of your brake pads and your brake fluid level.  As your brake pads wear, the distance that they need to travel to make contact with the rotor increases, brake fluid levels naturally decrease, and you will notice the brake pedal travel more as a result.  You should *not* add more fluid to the reservoir to compensate.  Just get your pads replaced.    It's also possible that you may have air in the lines.  Getting your brakes bled will help as well.  If you have air in the lines that didn't occur immediately after brake work was done, you may want to have your braking system inspected for leaks.    The overwhelming majority of people do not need performance brakes, yet companies prey on people's ignorance and sell them track equipment they don't need.  Just get a set of quality tires with a softer compound if you want better braking performance.",How about new fluid first ?  Simple = typically best solution.,1

Exhaust. Always get the catalytic converters their worth some money. The whole engine if it’s good and you know how. Including transmission.

"Do you know how old this belt is?  When it was installed and how many miles are on it?  The belt is squealing because it's either out of adjustment (too tight, too loose) or it's more worn than a visual inspection can show.  You can live with it for awhile, if you want, and the problem will probably get slowly worse over time.  That's fine until it's not, and the belt snaps.  You can also mask the symptoms for awhile, if you want, with belt dressing.  The problem will come back at some point.  This is also fine until it's not -- as the belt will eventually snap.  It's really just up to you in terms of when you want to replace the belt.  They're usually pretty cheap and usually pretty easy to replace.  If it was me, I'd probably do that.  Once you have the old belt off the car, inspect the inside (the side that faces the pulleys).  I'll bet, if you fold it backwards, you see lots of tiny cracks form.

I also do much of the work myself and source parts from cheaper online sources whenever possible, so my numbers wouldn't be representative of ""average"" anyways.   I'll say that the 2006 Mercedes Benz E350 4Matic I purchased for my wife back in January of 2015 was both the most elegant Subaru Outback-type car I've ever driven... And also the most complicated, annoying, and expensive beastie I've ever worked on. It used to be you could buy an old Benz and trust it forever, but those days are long since gone. I purchased that car for $9,500. Spent an average of $2,541 per year keeping it running (not including gas, just maintenance/repair costs). I sold it in August of 2019 for $6,000.  In comparison, the 2007 Honda Pilot I replaced it with was purchased in October of 2018 for $10,500. So far, I spent $1,322.34 in 2018 (had a shop do the timing belt) and only $349.40 in 2019 keeping it running.

"I live in the US, work in Detroit (General Motors) and live 15 minutes away from Woodward Avenue.  I'm honestly convinced this is the pinnacle of automotive enthusiasm.    The Dream Cruise is the largest one day auto event in the world.  Depending on weather and all that, we'll draw close to 2 million people.  It technically stretches about 30 miles from Detroit to Pontiac (all of Woodward Ave.) although the primary ""cruise"" areas are really from about 9 Mile Rd to Long Lake (18 Mile) and then once you get up in to Pontiac it gets very busy again.  The metro-Detroit area has a bit of everything, though, and for the most part nobody cares what it is.  We have old cars with new engines, we have Fords with Chevy engines, we have imports and domestics, etc.  There are certain stigmas attached to each type of car, although I think people do a good job of accepting just about anybody at formal car shows.  Unlike the OP, we get a ton of muscle cars.  Mustang, Camaro, Charger/Challenger, etc.  Those are by far the most popular.  Corvettes are another very common car.  We also have our share of imports.  Honda's have somewhat fallen out of favor, but more because they don't really make anything performance oriented anymore.  We still get a lot of Subaru, BMW and VW.  We get more than a handful of Mercedes.  In my area, with as big as the automotive aftermarket is and with how many enthusiasts there are, we see some more of the unusual side of things, too.

I mean we have big meets like the GTI meet at the Wörthersee, but car's are very expensive here due to taxes, insurance is through the roof because you have to pay monthly engine taxes based on your cars power.  Also, modded cars are rarer than unicorns, becaude everything has to be approved by the state which is expensive as fuck, complicated and takes forever.

"Im in the states. We have a little bit of everything, but in my experience the biggest cultures are by far Muscle, ricers, and 4x4/ offroad. Thats really general though. Different areas of the states also tend to have their own identities.","New Zealand car culture is pretty great. We have all types of cars over here, American, European, British, Australian, Chinese, Japanese, basically everything.   Mostly everyone has a respect for others cars and tastes, as there's a wide variety of both. There's plenty of people that own V8 Holdens and Fords or fast Euros, but these people generally aren't the car enthusiast type, they just want something fast that they can fit their family in. The majority of car people here are either into classics, like Impala, Mustang, XA Falcon, or your normal Japanese tuner car like WRX, Evo, or Skyline.   As far as I know you can't really live anywhere in NZ that isn't within about a 2hr drive of a racetrack so the general culture here is more one of function over form. Also helps that we have what's called a Warrant of Fitness, which is a safety check every 6 or 12 months depending on the age of the car, so you can't get away with stupid ass mods like crazy camber or dodgy lowering. But as far as mods go the sky's the limit, just as long as it's safe/done well.",1

You need a 2nd opinion.,"Go get a cooling system pressure tester, you can get them as a loaner tool. Put it on the system and pump it up. See if it loses any pressure over a day. No loss - no leaks. If it's a small leak and you want to try to find it you could pull the plugs and look, a leak into a cylinder will normally cause a plug to be different than the others.

"The more features you get, the more likely it is to breakdown More parts = more issues, so I would say : stay simple","they're all going to be about the same as far as maintenance frequency and cost.  long term reliability and repair costs, nobody really knows that.  Civic was all new for 2022, so hasn't really been long enough to know... but generally honda and toyota are the brands you want... and not a Jetta... if you plan to keep it a long time.  in reality, people who buy new cars usually have the means to buy a new car again and usually choose to do so.  If you figure you'll keep it 5 years then move into something newer, then it really doesn't matter all that much.  If you think you'll run it into the ground, I'd go with Hyundai just for the 10year/100k mile powertrain warranty.  Also most cities have at least one dealership that does the lifetime warranty for as long as you own the car as the original owner.

"As a German car owner (not a Jetta though).  I'll tell you that the fit and finish is a hair better on them but parts can be more expensive and working on them can be a bit tougher as they tend to be packaged tightly.  Reliability is as much to do with you as it will any of those cars.  The way you take care of your car will help in the reliability department other than some freak issues.  Cheap and available parts? Ease of maintenance? Can't go wrong with Honda or Toyota.  I bought my mom a Hyundai years ago. She put 280k on it and then gave it to my sister and bought another one.  Although I've never worked on one myself.  If it were me and those were my concerns I'd go with the civic. But you can't go wrong with the Corolla either.  But honestly, you're buying new.  You'll be fine with any of them.  It's more important that you like the car enough to care for it long term if you're the type to hold on to a car until it dies.  Go and drive a new example of each of them before you buy.","The more features you get, the more likely it is to breakdown More parts = more issues, so I would say : stay simple",1

"Toyota's recommended interval using full synthetic is 10,000 miles or once a year whichever comes first.  As far back as 1980, Mercedes suggested 12,000 miles with synthetic.  If it were my 2007 Civic I would go for 2 years using full synthetic.  This brings up another point; tires wear due to sunlight.  Consider changing out tires every 7 years regardless of miles.","I put about 2000 miles a year on my convertible (summer car only - it's stored for the winter).  I change my oil once a year - every spring right when I get it out of storage.  My scenario might be a bit different from yours.  I drive my car daily from May -> October (so, 10-30 miles per day) and then don't drive it at all from November->April.  If you are only putting 900 miles a year and don't have a break in the winter, then that means you are doing some very short trips daily (3 miles per day) or you are doing some longer trips with gaps in between (100 mile trip twice a month).  If you are doing semi-long trips on an infrequent basis then you are changing oil more than you need.  It's GOOD to get the car up to temperature and burn off any moisture in the system, etc.  It's BAD to do super-short trips that build up moisture & contaminants but never get the engine warm enough to burn them off.  So to summarize:    * If you're only driving on the weekends but are putting a couple dozen miles on it at a time (enough to get up to temp) then you can reduce the oil change frequency and do a change once a year or so.   * If you are driving 1 mile twice a day, then I'd keep doing more-frequent oil changes.  I'd probably reduce your frequence to a change every 6 months or so instead of every 3 (synth oil is expensive - but it does last longer and can tolerate short trips better than non-synthetic oil can).",1
"I started pretty late. I wasn't even into cars until about 21 or so. I remember buying a new Corolla in 2013. I had *serious* buyers remorse and I hated the car after watching so many bad reviews about it. That's when I started watching reviews on a bunch of other cars as well. I couldn't stop binge watching anything car-related and it took a serious toll on my grades in college. I can't stress how addicted I was but everything I know is self-taught. I went to a couple auto shows and I am subscribed to a bunch of YouTube channels but unfortunately, none of my social circle are into cars.","My grandpa owned a 1969 Chevelle SS Convertible.  We would hang out in his garage and work in it and his other cars together all the time.  We also went to a lot of car shows.    My uncle had a '91 Camaro Z/28 (mine now), and he and I would hang out and cruise around town when I was a kid.  I thought it was the coolest fucking car ever and I'm so glad that I was able to buy it from my uncle's estate.  It means a lot to me.

Exhaust wrap is designed for heat retention purposes, not to restrict/block exhaust gas release. Trust me, seen the soot marks around wraps on race header leaks.

At this point you have a valid safety concern about a known recall part. An exhaust wrap is not a solution. I would suggest pressing your concerns with Ford that you have not a pending safety problem but active one, and that you require a loaner until the safety problem can be resolved.",1

Don't drive like an a'hole and do 2/3rds maintenance every third cycle.,"There aren't any reliability mods, in general. If it could be tweaked to be more reliable, the folks who spent millions designing your car would have done it from the factory.  Sometimes there are specific exceptions if your vehicle has a known design flaw, like replacing a bearing known to fail or something like that, but outside correcting a known flaw, it is what it is reliability wise.  Not really a mod, but if there's salt on the roads you'd benefit from fluid film or some type of undercoating or rust prevention. Salt is a big car killer over time.",0
"If your commute / driving consists of shorter trips on average, I  think the biggest thing you can do is to ensure that your car gets properly up to temperature perhaps once a week. Combustion creates a fair bit of moisture (which is why we see plumes of exhaust in the winter). That water pools in the lowest parts of the exhaust (like the muffler) and, even worse, a lot of it stays bound up in the oil. If the engine (and engine oil) doesn't get all the way up to 100C, that moisture doesn't boil off and accumulates, accelerating corrosion of important steel bits like bearing surfaces and such.   So get it out on the highway for 20-30 minutes. Get it good and hot. Take the longer way home from work one day a week. It'll boil that water out of the exhaust and keep your engine oil clean. Your battery will thank you, as well!  The other thing worth doing, I think, is to spray a rust inhibitor over as much of the suspension as you can. Something lanolin-based, like Fluid Film. Spray the control arms, exposed bolts on the strut tops, etc. Doesn't hurt to be liberal with it, but DO keep it away from your brake rotors. ;-)",Don't drive like an a'hole and do 2/3rds maintenance every third cycle.,1

I just took the carpet and sound deadening out of my car. It's made quite a bit of difference. Race cars also have no muffler or catalytic converter so engine noise goes straight out. Straight cut gears in a transmission make a hell of a whine too. Street cars tend to have rubber bushings on all suspension pieces to help absorb noise and bumps. Racecars have no bushings or very very stiff bushings so that introduces a lot of creaks and pops.,Loud exhaust = less restricted = more flow = more fast,0
Loud exhaust = less restricted = more flow = more fast,"One thing I didn't see mentioned is the sound-deadening that's not in performance cars. Thicker glass on the windows, sound insulation on the chassis, softer suspension, well attached internals and larger tire sidewalls. While they don't directly lead to more noise, they do prevent a lot of the engine, exhaust, and road noise for the driver/passengers in addition to preventing rattling inside the car, and they save weight for performance vehicles by not adding them.      Even going from a Subaru Outback to an STi, the amount of road noise on any given drive is much louder in the STi. You can hear the cracks, bumps, and potholes you drive over in the performance oriented car where the outback just glided over them.",1

"i work in hvac-r, definitely dirty but not nearly as much as a mechanic, but heres what i do anyway:  wash my hands regularly and avoid touching my face at work. I use solvol at home, but most workshops would have gritty soap thats perfect for oil and grime.  shower every night facial clensing scrub in yhe shower twice a week, i just use an all natural ingredients one with bamboo to scrub dead skin and grime then i use a Enzyme cleansing gel every shower on my face, but any facial cleanser is good in combo with a scrub.  i use a hemp shampoo bar, because i have to wash my hair every day and any supermarket shampoo is just too harsh to use daily.  then i just use good quality moisturizer when im done showering.  Every now and then i do a pore cleansing face mask too  i know it sounds like a lot, but its actually a really simple routine to keep your skin nice as a tradesman.

"Gonna go against the grain here.  From a long term financial perspective, it's almost always more economical to repair an older car and drive it until the wheels fall off, irrespective of that car's value or the cost of repairs.  The justification is simple - depreciation on a new(er) vehicle will almost always exceed the cost of repairs for a given timeframe.  Say you spend $4000 to fix it, and it runs for another 3 years. Alternatively, you sell it and go buy a 3 year old CPO car fresh off a lease and keep it for another 3 years, net cost is $15k. On average you will lose $5k in value on that newer car anyway.  Now of course if you have $5k worth of repairs on a $2500 car and you want to sell it and buy an $8k car all of the above goes away, but that depends on your situation.","How do you know what repairs it needs?

Both also definitely have sporty get up and go.  Porsche Boxster. Find a late 90s early 2000s one with no ims bearing issue or a fixed one, that's an absolute must.

"When each piston is as low as it can go in the motor, Its how much fluid could ""fill"" the cylinder up to the valves, all added up.","What the other guy said - that number is ""displacement.""  An engine's job is to turn heat into movement.  \- Heat comes from burning gasoline and air together.  \- The amount of heat you can generate = the amount of movement (power) you can get.  \- The more gasoline + air you can move THROUGH the engine, the more heat you can generate.  This is why we're concerned with displacement.  A 3.2L audi V6 can move 3.2L of air/fuel inside it once per revolution.  A 5.0L mustang can move 5.0L of air/fuel inside it once per revolution.  In a 5.0 V8 Mustang, each cylinder can move 5/8 of a liter of air inside it each revolution.  5/8 of a liter \* 8 cylinders = 5.0 total L of displacement.  (There are lots of things you can do to make each L of displacement generate more heat, but that's a separate subject.  All things being equal, more displacement = more heat = more power.)  Edit: good point from galoluscus in order to be clearer.  While displacement is a measure of how much air/fuel can be moved once per revolution, the amount of air /fuel that is actually processed by the engine is half that in a 4 stroke.  Still, we use displacement as a measurement because it's directly indicative of throughput.",0

Which is part of the WEC championship, but is by far the most well known endurance race.  &#x200B;  IMSA and WEC also both have youtube channels  &#x200B;  https://www.youtube.com/user/UnitedSportsCar  &#x200B;  https://www.youtube.com/user/FIAWEC/videos  &#x200B;  Also for news and discussion, there is /r/formula1 and /r/wec which are pretty active.  &#x200B;  Edit:  &#x200B;  The F1 point system is a little complicated, so I thought I'd write a quick breakdown.  There are 2 championships in F1, the drivers and the constructors. Every constructor runs 2 cars, with 2 drivers, so every constructor has 1 entry into constructors, with double the number of entries into the drivers championship.  &#x200B;  The point breakdown is based on your finishing position and is as follows:  1: 25 points  2: 18 points  3: 15 points  4: 12 points  5: 10 points  6: 8 points  7: 6 points  8: 4 points  9: 2 points  10: 1 point  11+: No points.",1
"I assume you mean ""never change into reverse when the car us moving"". And yep great advice as you found out. Reverse gear does not have a synchro mesh systm like the rest of the gears. So the gearbox (and by association the wheels) must be stationary to get the gear. You can get a sutuation where it is still difficult to change into reverse directly after driving in 1st. This is because the lay shaft inside the box is still spinning. Best thing to do is while stationary put it in 1st gear then try reverse again. The synchro mesh system will stop the lay shaft from spinning and your reverse gear will engage nicer.","Sure as shit don't do it again, a bit of damage to the clutch, gears, maybe syncros, worst case scenario you end up replacing the clutch ($120) or the transmission ($300-500?) a little earlier than normal.

"Experience. I work as a delivery driver and let me tell you, it's super easy once you know the area. Nowadays, our system can route the whole thing, but most of the time, my own intuition pays off.   Things to look for when planning a route.   -know how many necessary stops there are on different routes. Sometimes a route could be faster even though it's longer because of speed limits and fewer traffic lights.   -knowing which street a stop light is bias too can help make routing decisions as well. If you can skip a light efficiently by cutting g through a neighborhood, do it. I feel as long as you are always moving towards your destination it's better than sitting at a light.   -have multiple routes for different times of day. If you're traveling during rush hour. Staying  in residential areas could potentially. Be faster for short drives.   - I personally am a fan of the mythical ""right hand turn only""  routes.

"I once bought a car without an inspection.  There was a rust hole in the gas fill tube, the gas tank had water in it.  I bought the car in Canada in the winter.  The water in the tank was ice.  I would fill it with gas, the liquid gas would get fed to the engine, the solid ice would not.  There were no problems.  Then spring time came.  The car started sputtering and misfiring like crazy, within a few blocks, the engine shut off and never turned on again.  Water in a cylinder, engine toast.  Should have got the inspection.  Asked but the guy said someone else was coming to look at it and he would sell it to them.  It was my first car, I was really excited to find one in my price range (I was broke) and bought it without doing the inspection my dad had always taught me to do.  Dad always told me, ALWAYS get an inspection on a used car.  But I had done enough work on back yard cars  with my friends and stuff.  I was wrong, I was blinded by excitement of buying my first car.","It's still a seller's market right now.  If you're asking for an inspection you come across as a tire kicker who is likely to try to beat the seller up on the price, especially if the inspection reveals issues.  Why would a seller bother with that when they can just as easily find some sucker who will pay full asking price sight-unseen?  With that said-- I would never buy a car without giving it a thorough inspection.

All of the V6 muscle cars you mentioned have over 300 horsepower and will run 0-60 in the 5 second range. Which is still fast. V6 Camaro goes 0-60 in 5.2. Quick.,"They definitely have the cheaper options so more people can afford them, and smaller engines likely help their overall emissions requirements. That being said, the base mustang is still 310hp/350tq, the Camaro is 275hp/295tq.   Compare that to a base Civic with 158hp/138tq, Altima 188hp/180tq, Camry 176hp/163tq. That doesn't even consider curb weight and suspension advantages.",0
"I'm a big fan of Miatas. They're slow. Many minivans will out-accelerate Miatas in a straight line. But, like you suggested, handling is really different.  The Miata has 50/50 weight distribution (with driver, and ""roughly""). While this isn't perfect (45/55 is better for performance driving), it's extremely good and far better than most front engined cars achieve. This helps the car have a more responsive turn-in, so when you want to turn a corner the car feels more lively, more playful, more fun. It also helps the car have more consistent, predictable behavior in turns and if traction should be lost, makes managing slides easier. If you look up F/R weight distributions, lots of sports and sporty cars try to get more and more weight on their back. Many BMWs do this, even when they have a lot of weight in the front. The engineers work hard to try to even out the weight distribution.  The suspension design of a Miata is different from that of a ""normal"" car (family sedan, even small practicality-focused hatchback). The older ones have double-wishbone on all four, while the newer have double-wishbone front and multilink rear. Normal cars often have designs like MacPherson struts. You can look into this area a lot more if you'd like, but a quick version: As the suspension compresses, the angles change. This changes the way the tire touches the ground (contact patch), which changes how the car turns (and brakes and accelerates). A better suspension design helps keep a more consistent contact patch as the car moves through different behaviors. This makes the car more predictable at its limits, so easier/more controllable when pushing.  Weight is the enemy of performance (and efficiency). Weight harms acceleration, cornering, and braking (as well as fuel mileage). Sports cars tend to spend at least some of their money/budget on using lighter weight materials. My third gen Miata has some steel body panels (cheap, easy to work with, strong and repairable), like most cars, but it has some aluminum panels (more expensive material, more expensive to manufacture, more expensive to repair, but lighter). This helps save weight. More expensive sports cars will use other materials – many (all?) Corvettes use fiberglass body panels, as does the Elise/Exige. These are light, but difficult to repair when they take damage. The muscle cars you mention are still pretty heavy, but that's because lightweight materials are expensive. Part of the intent of those muscle cars is accessible performance. Keeping costs down is important. And so they accept more weight so they can be less expensive.  Most ""normal"" cars these days are FWD or front-biased AWD. While ""sporty"" cars vary, sports cars (the muscle cars you mention, the Miata, Corvette, Elise/Exige, etc., etc.) are often RWD, rear-biased AWD, or AWD that's capable of sending power to different wheels extremely dynamically. These drivetrains are better for sporty driving. Accelerating moves weight to the rear, increasing rear grip and reducing front grip. All else equal, a car accelerates better if power is going to the rear wheels. Putting power to the front wheels also makes those tires have to do more work. Nearly all of a car's braking comes from its front tires (for normal cars, ""most"" for typical sports cars, and ""about half"" for the rear-engined 911). A lot of the cornering loads are on the front. And if you put acceleration loads on the front, well, now you have the front tires doing a *huge* amount of work and the rears not doing nearly so much. It's better to split that work between different areas. Normal cars still use FWD because, with the engine in the front, they get more efficient packaging that way. If what's important to your buyer is maximizing interior space without increasing exterior space, front engined FWD is great. But it's not as great for performance.  There are a lot of other little differences. The seating position in a sports car is rather different from in a family sedan. The gearing and compression ratios tend to be different (as another commenter said). The look of the gauges, even which gauges are installed, can be different. And, yes, they look cool. Wanting to look cool isn't bad, either. On each of these ideas, there's a lot more information out there, a lot more to satisfy your curiosity with some web searches. Maybe see if Engineering Explained has a video about it. Dig in and explore. There are a lot of differences that aren't obvious at a glance, but can lead to a lot of interesting exploring and learning.",All of the V6 muscle cars you mentioned have over 300 horsepower and will run 0-60 in the 5 second range.

The Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio has a 2.9L V6. It puts out over 500hp and 440 lb-ft of torque.  We've become really good at getting power out of small packages.,"Most 4 and 6 cylinder sports cars are still lighter than the other cars that use the same engines, so they're often still faster.  For example, a 2017 V6 Camaro has the same engine as my 2017 Chevy Equinox (company car), but the Camaro is about 1.5 seconds quicker 0-60. In the case of the Mustang, for a time, they offered a V6, a 4 cylinder turbo, and a V8. The engine output of the V6 and 4 cylinder turbo were nearly the same, so they dropped the V6. In the case of the Camaro and Mustang, the ""small"" engines are as powerful as the V8s from roughly a decade ago.",1
"Shaking is likely out of balance or damaged tire. I would consider it unsafe if I was looking at it and would try to knock the cost of the repair off the price. Cosmetic wise it depends on what it is, I would expect a few dings, worn pedals and other wear like the steering wheel, controls and such. But if it is something like stained seats or dirty interior that could be easily cleaned I would also wonder how well the rest was taken care of.    My suggestion would be to check out the shaking and at least have a ballpark of the cost of the repair, but I'd repair it before sale. Cosmetics wise, if you are thinking about a 4-5K price then having a pro clean and detail it might be a good investment, plus it would be done if you decided to keep it.","Howdy! I've been there several times, here's how I break it all down:  1) Time. If I have time to mess around with this vehicle, i'll put some time and energy into it. If i'm crunched for time, like when I moved for a job and couldn't take both cars with me, then I just sell it as-is, full disclosure, whatever price I can get for it.   2) Trade vs sell. You'll almost always get less money trading it in than you would selling it yourself, almost.

"So, batteries and cold weather. Nothing kills a battery worse than having it drain down in the cold. Fully charged, there's lots of ions in the acid.

"Lol after the first line I was like, ""its a subaru isnt it"". Fellow 06 impreza owner here. The good news is that the engines are pretty cheap and easy to replace. I personally would be looking at local junkyards if possible to save money on any shipping costs. Shipping an engine like that could double what you pay for it in todays age. Before you go out shelling for a new engine, is it possible that the engine may just need a new head gasket? Older subarus are WELL known for their head gasket issues and a head gasket issue can easily cause these misfires you're having. At the very minimum I would do a compression test on the cylinders, but this may tell you nothing if the head gasket is bad. But if it somehow passes compression, then there is a decent chance you don't need a new engine at all. I would get a new engine lined up but not purchased, have the old engine removed and have its head gaskets replaced and then a compression test run before putting it back in. If it fails, get the new engine.",I am a fan of car-part.com. It's an online searchable database for parts from junkyards across the country.,1

Is the truck in neutral when you're shifting the tcase?,"4L requires you to be stopped, and in neutral.

"Odo discrepancy can affect value on car fax. Had a friend with an m3 with low mileage and the dealer didn't believe it and did some sort of ""adjustment""  If the +60k mileage got reported, then it'll limit buyers. Big difference between someone wanting to buy a car with 110k vs 170k","I have a 34 year old Chevy Cavalier that has a mileage discrepancy on it, so I have a little experience here.  In my case, the VSS (vehicle speed sensor) was bad and it was displaying 120mph when you were actually going 15-20 -- with a corresponding faster odometer increase.  Drive 1 mile and it registered 10 on the odometer, I believe!!  I bought it with ""180,000"" but believe it was actually closer to 100,000 in reality.  Very similar to your situation.  The discrepancy didn't phase me whatsoever.  A total non-issue to me.  If this was a newer vehicle or if it was a highly-sought-after vehicle I'd be concerned.  However, you have a 20 year old car that that, frankly, will never be a Barret-Jackson 6-figure numbers-matching auction special (I'm in the same boat with my Cavalier :) ).    Once you hit that kind of age, the miles don't matter nearly as much as the condition of the car (barring edge cases - a 35 year old car with 10,000 miles on it can be a big deal for some people -- similarly a 35 year old car with a million miles on it will have its own set of fans.  Both extremes can raise the price)  you have 60,000 miles discrepancy - spread out over 20 years would be an additional 3000 miles per year, which is nothing to most people.  In this case a 110,000 mile, 20 year old car is averaging 5500 miles per year, and a 170,000 mile 20 year old car is averaging 8500 miles per year.  NOTHING.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Document the swap and mileage difference (save your receipts for it) and enjoy the car.  When it comes time to sell it, it'll be a 250,000 mile, 30 year old car and all you have to do is say the cluster was swapped with a 60K discrepancy and here's the receipt.  Heck, at that age, bluebook values no longer exist anyway and you will have to use comparable sales to determine value anyway.",0
"It depends on your state/local laws. My state says that anything 10 years or older is exempt from odometer accuracy. If you check the title it just says “exempt”. That said, I’ve been told it’s up to the clerk who enters the information at the time of titling on whether or not the mileage still gets reported. I’ve seen some CarFax reports for cars well over 10 years old where one instance CarFax says “mileage not reported” or something similar, then the more recent registration in the same state will have a believable mileage.   As far as your situation goes, I can’t offer much advice. If you’ve already been to the DMV and all paperwork has been submitted, I imagine it’d be easier to pull shark’s teeth than getting the “error” corrected. I’m sure there’s a process for having errors corrected, such as this one, but there will be plenty of bureaucratic hoops to jump through to make it happen.","Odo discrepancy can affect value on car fax.

The biggest issue you see between the two is the balancing of the engine. You have weight from the pistons rising and falling and just doing their jobs. In a 4 cylinder you have two go up and two go down working to balance each other out. In a 3 cylinder it's not as well balanced and can feel rougher. That's really the only thing that's going to affect reliability differently. It may cause slightly more wear on things as it's not as smooth. But I'd say it's pretty negligible.,"Short answer:  Three cylinder engines aren't inherently less reliable than four cylinder engines and I don't think that your stalling issue is related to your engine configuration.  Stalling off idle can be the result of a dirty air or fuel filter, both issues potentially solved by giving the car a good service. If the error persists, you can ask any workshop to check for codes via the on-board diagnostic system (OBD).    Long answer: Personally I recently bought a new to me (secondhand) Focus Focus as a family car. I had the choice between two 125HP engines: a normally aspirated four cylinder 1.6 and a turbocharged three cylinder 1.0.  In theory the 1.6 should be more reliable  * No turbo, intercooler or stop/start system = less things to go wrong  * Lower specific output (I.e. power per liter) means engine internals are under less stress   * Proven reliable engine design  OTOH the 1.0 EcoBoost produces more torque and consumes significantly less fuel. And in practice the engine has proven itself reliable over the last eight years.  Personally I decided to take a certain 25% fuel saving over an acceptable (IMO) reliabilty risk. The vehicle is pretty new by my standards (2017 with 70k km) and I plan to sell it on before it hits 150k km.  Conversely if I lived off the grid and reliabilty was a matter of life or death I would have chosen an old-school non-turbo four.",1

"Gas question first. No reason to use premium. Inside most fuel doors it will say premium if that is recommended. Just fill it up with some regular 85 octane or whatever is near you.   Synthetic doesn't break down as quickly as conventional, but my Avalon hybrid is a 5k mile intervals and my Lexus SUV is 10k mile intervals. You could always have an oil analysis performed at 5k and see if it still has extra life in it and adjust accordingly.   I'd guess you can go farther, but $100 bucks every 4 or 5 months is cheap insurance for knowing your oil is healthy.","Read your owner's manual, it'll tell you what octane rating you need based on engine options. If you put in lower than recommended, you'll wind up getting some engine knock, misfires, and potentially lower fuel economy.   The owner's manual will also have service intervals. If you plan on keeping the car forever, I would suggest doing oil changes and other regular maintenance on the lower end of the scale to preserve reliability.",0

"You’re in an interesting place with your Avalon. You just spent / need to spend a significant amount of money on an aging car you don’t love. It seems like a money pit, but the items you are addressing are pretty typical for a car with 100k and once replaced, those parts will last another 100k.   If your car has been well maintained for all of its life, the most financially sound decision is to keep driving and maintaining it.   This goes doubly so with the current car market where prices of everything have inflated dramatically.","Personally, I look at two things. When does cost of upkeep become like a car payment? When can I no longer rely on the car?  For the first, I'll give my coworker as an example. He bought a 20 year old F-250 with really high mileage because it's ""paid off"" and ""diesels run forever."" He's sunk about $10k into it in one year of ownership. Constant repairs. Technically, he does own it. For the money he has into it, he could've been making low interest payments on a much newer, nicer, and more reliable truck.   For the second part, I'll use myself. My last car was having frequent issues despite relatively low miles. Several electrical problems meant it wouldn't start for me to get to work. Once it was tainted in my mind as unreliable, I just couldn't drive it anymore. Getting to and from work is 99% of what I need from a car. If I can't trust it to start or get me to and from work, I need to find something reliable.   Just my .02 of course. Good luck with what you decide!",1

Divide that by 12 and see if it's cheaper than a car payment (it probably is) then pay yourself that monthly amount in a separate account. If the car needs repairs it comes out of this account, if it doesn't then you let it grow until you have a nice chunk for a down payment. If the car is breaking enough that you're missing work or if it needs a major repair like a transmission then it's time to start car shopping. With the market the way it is now you are better off keeping the Avalon on the road for another year or so. If and when you go for a replacement be sure to factor in the increased insurance costs for a new (or newer) car.   At 100k miles there are probably a lot of wear items that need to be replaced. Spark plugs, filters, belts, fluid changes and brakes are easy DIY jobs that can save you money. Suspension items can be more time consuming but aren't that hard. Look at the owners manual and see what services are recommended around 100k miles, that will give you an idea of what to expect and budget for.",1
"I think comparing cost of repairs vs value is a valid way to do it, but a lot of these methods aren't factoring in a few variables:  1.)

"8500 km is -a bit- very early, but it is likely the discs get surface rust between each drive if they drive that little, and it could be wearing a lot the first few stops each time - a rusted disc acts as sandpaper on the pads.  Also it is highly likely tat old folks drive very carefully and brake lightly, and that leads to calipers seizing up from not being used, which lead to uneven pad wear - only using the inner pad, for example.  I think it COULD be time, but have a look for yourself before ordering the work done. Shine a flashlight through the wheel and look at the edges of the pads.","Maybe, brake pad do no deteriorate with the pass of the years, if they never been changed maybe they need to be changed.

The emissions inspectors will absolutely know it's not the correct engine. It will fail visual.  The swap would have to be approved by a BAR referee. For a car as new as the RX-8 with an engine as dissimilar as the V8 this is going to be essentially impossible.,"There's a lot of misinformation in some of these posts.    First off, here's the link to the BAR guidelines. This is a good start.  https://www.bar.ca.gov/Industry/Engine_Change_Guidelines.html  Here's the highlights:  1. If the car was originally a California Emissions car, then Swap motor must be a California emissions motor as well.  2. Motor must be same year or newer.  3. Motor must be from same class of vehicle, I.e. truck to truck car to car etc. No truck motors in a car etc.  4. All emissions gear must be retained on the new swap motor and the chassis its going into.  If a guy is selling a car on CL with a legit BAR inspected swap, they will say it and be more than willing to prove it. They will also want more money for the because it is such a pain in the ass to go through. Most of the swapped cars on CL haven't been BAR'd and have been getting SMOG hookups from shops so they can get registered and skirt the rules.    Tl;dr theres more rules, but it can be done. I wouldn't bat an eye until I saw a BAR sticker and a SMOG test.  Most people on Craigslist are too lazy to go through the process.",0

Which is especially easy for cars like toyotas.  You can try crutchfield like others have said, but that will be mostly aftermarket stereos that will be very different from stock. On the other sites I mentioned, you will probably be able to get the stock parts.  I always check rockauto first. Then if they don't have it, I search on eBay. Only thing to note is that for eBay especially, you'll need to know the exact name of the part or have a part number.  Edit: no idea why I'm being downvoted when this is solid advice. I've only ever really owned old cars and replacing parts seems like a monthly routine. Especially things like window motors and actuators. I guess the biggest question is are you trying to replace the parts with stock parts or are you trying to upgrade them to a newer aftermarket part. It's just replacing back to stock check out the websites I recommended, otherwise crutchfield is good for upgraded electronics.",0

"What's good for the auto companies and the cars they make is zero emissions control devices... Optimal thermal efficiency, no back pressure, no exhaust in the intake, less carbon buildup, proper oil viscositys etc. not to mention the engines computer and software would be significantly simpler if they only need to monitor the things to make an engine run right and not any of the other stuff  But they currently need to engineer the vehicle around emissions and mpg standards  Not saying any of it is bad... We need it because we need to breathe the air we live in   it's just things like higher compression ratios lead to higher efficiency but also hotter combustion temps thus higher Nox emissions which is a no no from gvt regs.

"I know this isn’t /r/personalfinance but I wonder if you can only afford one $50 inspection can you afford to repair and repair either vehicle? Both are around $3k so I assume that’s your cap. Since neither of those cars are known for reliability, what about something a little older, less of an initial price, and more reliable?   Here is a 2001 Bonneville - only asking $2k. One owner, lowish miles, supposedly well maintained, good tires, the great 3.8 motor and plenty roomy.   Edit - correct link - https://grandrapids.craigslist.org/cto/d/01-bonneville-one-owner-low/6560782836.html","Here's my opinion, I've been in the car business nearly 20yrs now and given a choice between these two vehicles, I'd keep looking for better options. There are definitely more reliable vehicles out there. That being said, if your committed to purchasing one of the above, then here's some general information to help you out. Both vehicles are manufactured by GM which means both will have readily available parts. However, the Trailblazer for the most part has remained unchanged for many years meaning if you're a junkyard mechanic (getting used parts from a junk yard vs new parts from a retail outlet, a very cost saving practice for keeping an older car on the road) then the Trailblazer is a great option. I mention parts and repair because neither of things vehicles are expected to remain maintience free. They will have issues and they will need repairs. They're both ""higher"" mileage domestics. Another note worthy mention is that they're both made from cheaply assembled plastic parts. Overall interior condition would be a huge indicator for me. If it's been abused inside, it's a safe bet that it wasn't taken care of in any other aspect either. Lastly, consider your usage. Is this a back and forth to work car, are you hauling a lot of stuff and/or people. Is the trailblazer 4x4? Do you need 4x4? Do you want to sit up higher with greater visibility or lower with more responsive handling? Neither car is a clear winner over the other, instead, I would focus on your needs as your main deciding factor unless one vehicle has clear warning signs over the other one.   Final note: The trailblazers can be very reliable vehicles and when something does break, it's generally very cheap and easy to replace. I wouldn't be weary of the owner replacing so many things. My guess all of these parts were worn with age, not broken down prematurely meaning as you've said, it's been ""refreshed"". The saturn is only 40k miles behind and if it hasn't had any repairs you can bet worn out parts will start popping up very soon. Would matter the make or model of the car, everything has parts that wear out in that 150-180k mile range.",1

"To actually answer your question, what you want to do is to weld the header together so that pairs of cylinders join together before the whole. Figure out the firing order then join the two consecutive firing pistons into two pairs. For instance, cylinders firing off first and second join together into one tube and cylinders firing 3rd and 4th are joined together into a second tube. Once that's done, target an RPM you want the car to sound good at. Design the length of one of the pairs of cyl's so that it meets the exhaust pulse at the same time as the other.  What this is doing is essentially mimicing the pressure dynamics of the v8, whereby two cylinders fire at the same time. In the I4 they won't ever fire at the same time but the exhaust pulses will meet at the same time and give a more robust ""thump"".  This will sound good in a narrow RPM band, I can assure you of that. But it will net you -10 - 20% horsepower because you can expect to lose all exhaust scavenging. Also good luck with packaging.

"Number one, you need to be there when they start it back up the first time. It should be loud for about 3 seconds and then immediately quiet down as soon as it gets oil flow. There should be no warning lights on the dash at that time. If it is nice and quiet, drive it back to the oil shop and have them clean up all the oil all over the bottom of your car with a solvent that really takes the oil off. You need to ensure that at that time, the oil drain plug tightens up snugly to know that the female threads in the pan are not stripped. There also may be dtc in the background of the engine computer that is applicable. I would have them document and clear it. If all seems to be fine, check service history and make sure the timing belt has been done on this vehicle they are due at 90-120k miles.

What code is it throwing? You can ask the mechanic or take it to any auto parts shop to check this.,"This is absolutely diagnoseable. What code(s) are triggering the CEL? Your mechanic should be able to tell you that -- you should ask for details of what lead them to replace the parts they did. I'd recommend talking to them, but if you just never want to speak to them again, many car parts stores will run your codes for free. Heck, you can even buy a Bluetooth OBD-II reader on Amazon these days, and check your codes on your phone.   It's of course certainly possible if you got the car back and the CEL was still on that they just didn't clear the codes after replacing the parts.. you could try clearing the codes and then running the vehicle through a compete drive cycle (look it up on Google for your car, likely involves multiple start/stop sessions as well as different multiple speeds for certain amounts of time). If you're super lucky, maybe the CEL stays off after the drive cycle is complete. Of course, the flip side of that coin is they cleared the codes and gave you the car back before the drive cycle was complete -- and this is likely true if the CEL came back on shortly (within a few days, depending on your driving habits) after you got the car back from them.   So (and I'm making assumptions you've got some sort of exhaust / O2 sensor codes here) -- in terms of what else might be wrong with your car: you could still have an exhaust leak between your pre-cat and post-cat O2 sensors. One of your O2 sensors could be bad, or not installed correctly (I've seen both, even with brand new sensors). It's also possible your problem isn't actually on the exhaust side, but the intake side. I had a few pin hole cracks on an intake manifold of a 2007 Benz E-class.. this intake leak was causing O2 sensor errors. After much banging my head against the wall and spending too much throwing parts at it... A simple smoke test found the pin hole leaks, and might be a good next step for you to consider.

"Most bang for your buck, nitrous cannot be beat. sometimes too much bang. Really your best bang for buck is a full nice exhaust and a TUNE.

Nitrous is cheap on the installation, but expensive and inconvenient on the consumables.      Turbos/supercharger are both expensive on the installation, but slighly less expensive on consumables (gas) and more convenient, because you can buy gas just about anywhere.      The exhaust systems of the VQ37HR are actually pretty effective at producing power. You'll get a little bit, but you're looking at thousands for a full header back exhaust that might net you 10-15 hp which, unless you're driving flat out all the time, will be nearly imperceivable and totally replicated by simply using more throttle. Any exhaust for these cars is generally on the ""noisy as fuck side"" so keep that in mind too.      Intakes don't do much on this vehicle. the stock ones already draw cold air almost directly into the throttle body from the nose of the car, at the diameter of the throttle body. Only wins might be weight, but not enough you'd perceive it on the street, and again, loud af, with no real gains.      This is not a platform that supports cheap power increases like literally any turboed platform where a reflash can get you perceivable differences thanks to boost coming on earlier and more thanks to mapping.      I'd say enjoy driving the car for what it is, but.. you bought the AWD version, so even that's kind of a buzzkill.

Is it now making a noise every time you hit a bump? Or it just made a bad sound as you hit the pothole? It’s really hard to say from an online post but if your concerned about it you can take it to the dealer or any independent shop and ask for an inspection of the suspension components. They can check it out and let you know if something broke.   Years ago I had just bought a Jetta Wolfsburg that was modified/lowered and was driving it over to my buddies house to show it off. I smashed into a massive pothole and after that my steering wheel was crooked going straight and every bump I heard a rattling sound from the front right. Ended up tightening down the strut nut and got an alignment and it was good to go. What I’m trying to say is it could be several things or absolutely nothing. If you don’t hear any strange sounds that were not there before and it still drives great then you should have nothing to worry about.,Sounds like it's still driving straight and the wheels/tires aren't damaged?   You should be fine - most cars don't get damaged from running over single bumps too fast. If you feel like being thorough you can have someone check the alignment and look underneath. But I wouldn't bother unless I noticed damage or if the car wasn't driving straight.,0

"Incorrect. Engine speed is only one factor for fuel consumption. The other is engine load, I.e. how much throttle are you applying.  Any engine will operate at different efficiencies depending on the speed and load with an island of peak efficiency at high loads and low speeds. And regions of least efficiency at high speeds and low loads (25% throttle and below)  Due to the torque multiplication of the transmission gear ratios, the engine operates at a lower load in 2nd gear at 2000rpm than in 3rd at the same speed. Thus it is consuming more fuel per unit of power in 2nd.

Bare Brick  I found that when sprayed on concrete to remove graffiti, it would also take ALL the oil and grease stains from cars off.  You spray it in, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, and then pressure wash it off.  A heated water pressure washer works beat, but I’m sure a non heated machine would do the truck with a little bit more washing.  It was pretty crazy how effortlessly that stuff pulled stains out. Sometimes I’d have to rub the concrete with a hard bristle brush before pressure washing. And as a fair warning, don’t stand down wind when you are spraying it on!! It will mildly burn your skin!!

"> I’ve owned the car for 4 days. A seemingly healthy 2001 Honda CR-V from one owner (older lady).  I think you're working yourself up since it's a new car to you. You didn't do anything wrong, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with shifting with the car off.   There's a brake/shift interlock as someone else mentioned that is basically a solenoid that activates when you hit the brake so you can move the shifter out of Park. That's normally what you would hear, and you can even test it by sometimes resting your hand lightly on the gear shift and hitting the brake and you'll actually feel the interlock release.","Was the key in Run position when you shifted the first time (and just the engine was off)?  If so, there was nothing you did that could have damaged the car.  It sounds like you are describing the BTSI solenoid (Brake Transmission Shift Interlock) which is designed to keep you from shifting out of park without having the brake pedal depressed.  The solenoid sticks on some vehicles and most owners don't notice because they never try shifting out of park without pressing the brake.  If you pulled it out of park with the key out, it's possible you jostled the solenoid loose and it just started working again.",1

"I would do some googling or maybe there's a Monte Carlo subreddit. I doubt your brakes are small enough to fit a 14"" rim, that's tiny. As far as performance goes, it's going to depend on what size tire you put on. You can use a tire calculator to find what would get you to the same size diameter. On the 14"" wheel you're going to get a much bigger sidewall which will be a smoother ride but won't help cornering. Fuel mileage shouldn't change too much as long as you go with the same brand and model of tire you've got on there now.",It will depend on the size of your brake rotors and/or drums.

It will depend on the size of your brake rotors and/or drums. Most vehicles come with the minimal size wheel stock so anything smaller usually won’t fit.,"The short answer to that is ""maybe, probably not.""  -- and in your case, the answer is going to be ""NO it won't work.""  There are a lot of things to consider when swapping rims.  Number 1 is the lug hole locations.  Here's a picture showing all the relevent measurements:  https://i.b5z.net/i/u/1631707/i/ATV-UTV_Wheels_Offset_Sizes_explained.jpg    Your 01 Monte has 5x114 lug holes.  This means your car has 5 lug studs that are 114 mm in diameter.  Your 88 Monte wheels are 5x4.75 inches -- which is 5x120.65mm.  So right off the bat, you're done because the holes won't line up with the lug studs so you won't be able to mount the tires.  FYI I got these numbers from:   https://www.wheel-size.com/size/chevrolet/monte-carlo/2001/   https://www.wheel-size.com/size/chevrolet/monte-carlo/1988/    Now, let's assume that the lug holes DO line up - so both tires are 5x114.  Now, you have to make sure that the inside diameter of the wheel can clear the brake calipers.  If you have huge brakes, you have to have a wheel that is large enough that the calipers can fit inside it.  Again, if the wheel can't fit over the brakes, you won't be mounting that tire.  Finally, you need to look at tire width, height, and offset.  If the tire is too wide, you will start hitting the inside of the wheel well or other components when you turn.  If the tire is too tall, you might end up rubbing against the fender.  If the tire offset is incorrect (the spacing within the tire), it might stick out too far and your tire will basically be OUTSIDE the fender, or it might stick too far inward and you start rubbing against the suspension components.  Basically, everything has to line up or it's not going to work.  OK, let's say everything DOES line up.  You were able to go from a 16"" wheel that was 5x114 and 225mm in diameter to a 15"" wheel that is 5x114, 225mm in diameter, and still clears the brake calipers.  Then you start looking at tire size.  Your original tire was 225/60R16.  The '16' means a 16"" diameter wheel.  the '225' means 225 mm wide.  the '60' is an aspect ratio.  The sidewall of the tire is 60% of the width.  For a 225mm wide tire, you will have 225*0.60 = 135mm sidewalls.  This means the total diameter of the wheel + tire combo is 676 mm.  Your tire will turn 578 revolutions per mile (this is used to calculate the speedometer)  Our hypothetical new tire is also 225mm wide.  If we go with a 225/60R15 tire (15"" diameter, 225mm width, 60% aspect ratio) then your tire will have 225*0.60 = 135mm sidewalls, but add in the 15"" diameter instead of the 16"" original diameter, you end up with 650mm tall tire.  The original was 676mm tall. Your car now sits 26mm lower your tire will turn. 787 revolutions per mile.  Your speedometer will now be off by about 3 mph at 65mph (you will be driving 65 but your speedometer will read 68mph).  The solution here would be to adjust the aspect ratio.  If you start with a 225/60R16 tire, you want a 225/65R15 tire to go along with your new 15"" rim.  Moving from the 60% aspect ratio with 16"" rim to a 65% aspect ratio with 15"" rim will essentially keep the outside diameter of the tire the same.  your speedometer will read 69.7mph when your true speed is 70mph.

"Definitely just leave Overdrive alone, it won't bother anything when you're in city traffic and it's only gonna help out on the highway.   As for the tires, they are high performance all season tires, meaning they're not meant for heavy snow, as commonly seen in Canada. They're great for regular snow, rain and summer, but they shouldn't be a first choice when the snow starts dumping. They're good to use for summer and spring in that car. Typically tires like this are used on 911s or M3s that the owners don't swap tires on.  Price wise I think you did just fine. 156k isn't too terrible on its own, but the Crown Vic was specifically built to be reliable and easy to repair. With it being a fleet vehicle and the Panther Platform built as such, repairs and parts are about as dirt cheap as it can get.

"Okay, they're not charging for how long it actually takes, you're not getting billed while they're doing something else. The ""Book"" is the standard of measurement for how long a given job should take, they reference that ""Book"" in order to do estimates and billings.  So the ""Book"" told them it takes 1.7 hours for the front, and one 1.7 hours for the rear, or 32 minutes for each wheel. Regardless of how long it takes the individual mechanic to actually do it, thats how much labor they charge based on their posted labor rate.   This system incentives the mechanic to be expedient, if they finish the job in *less* time than the book says, they can start on another job, increasing their income per real world hour. While at the same time it does not penalize the customer, because the slow mechanic happened to work on *your* car instead of the fast mechanic.   That being said, 32 minutes per wheel seems excessive, but than I am not familiar with a '10 edges brake set up, who knows maybe theres some fuckery in there that extends the Book time.   A further note regarding the mention of ""rotors"". Its pretty standard practice to ""turn"" rotors, which is to restore them to a smooth finish for longevity. Might be part of the cost and time was that process. Also, its 2 pads per wheel, for 8 pads total.","The two common books for independent shops are Mitchell (Identifix) and AllData.  Most mechanics beyond lube techs are flat rate, meaning they get paid a set amount per job whether they take a half hour or two days.  The book times reflect what an average mechanic can do the work in using standard tools.    Mechanics can use tricks or expensive specialised tools to cut down their actual time, meaning they book more hours than they worked and make more money.  This balances out more difficult jobs where book time does not account for things like rusted bolts and mechanics lose money by taking longer than billed for.  1.7 isn't completely unreasonable but 1.3 sounds more like the rate you should have been charged.  Were you not given an estimate beforehand?  That's what the labour books are for - so you can get an accurate estimate before agreeing to the work.",1

"I'm used to MAFs that can meter around 500hp worth of air and are usually run in parallel twin setups anyways. But generally MAF is a little easier to tune for in terms of low speed driveability. But it also means the car will have running issues if there are any vacuum leaks, and you pretty much can't run VTA BOVs. MAF setups are also a little more flexible when it comes to throwing breather mods on the car, whereas MAP will need the tune adjusted in a lot of cases. MAP has a much higher ceiling in regards to amount of metered air, and paints a more accurate picture of what's actually in the manifold. It also does a better job of reacting to rapid changes in intake air volume, where MAF may have a slight delay if the MAF is at the front of a long intake tract, and would require a throttle response routine to estimate incoming air before the MAF starts seeing it.

"The Rush looks kind of like a RAV4 with a couple extra seats where the cargo area is. Just from eyeing it, it looks like it might be on the same platform.

"Toyota basically has 4 SUVs for sale on the US market. The Rav4 is the smallest, no 3rd row seating so you'd be limited to 5 seats and its basically just a tall car with all wheel drive.

Two seats pull up in the back for a total of 7, it appears to be the same size as the rush from what I can tell, likely built on the same platform. It also comes with the 4 cylinder engines you'd find in the car models (my 07 highlander had a 2.4, got decent gas mileage) and I believe a hybrid v6 as well. I loved my highlander.

"There isn't really. Maybe big turbo K24? They put them in a ton of different cars/SUVs but there's certain top/bottom end combos which are more desirable. With some internals and decent heads you can run a good amount of boost through them and make a somewhat reliable 700hp or go much higher if you want but you start running into diminishing returns and rapid unplanned disassembly becomes significantly more likely. Boostedboiz have a couple of really fast k24 cars, their MR2 just broke into the 7s quarter mile and there's many other content creators out there doing crazy things with those Honda motors. As far as I can tell the K20/K24 is the new SR20 swap, people are putting them in everything.   That said, there's a reason that the LS/LT v8 is the most common swap for racing. You can pull a vortec 350 out of any chevy truck made in the last ~20 years for $400, slap a cam and a turbo on it and make the same power for half the money and a lot less fuss. Cleetus McFarland bought a junkyard c6 vette and pulled a motor from a tahoe or something out of a junkyard, put a giant turbo on it, and ran 8 sec 1/4 miles no problem. You can buy crate LS engines straight from summit racing that already make big power and just pop it in if you have the money. Parts are cheap and plentiful, there's a ton of information and guides, and you can get complete swap kits for anything from an NA miata to a new mustang.

A re-manufactured CV shaft with boot installed correctly is ~$60 a piece for a 2004 Elantra.    A boot alone is 15-$20 each. You will need $10 in solvent to clean the joints otherwise the grit left behind will continue to destroy the joint. You should properly dispose of the solvent and grease waste taking extra time. You will also need a $20 tool to tighten the bands on the new boots.     After all that add your time in. Lots of ways to save time and money doing the work yourself but CV boots never turn out to be one of them.    If its your first time you could end up spending $30 on rags and cleanup. Fouled axle grease is an absolute mess. The super fine ground particulate in addition to the grease stains almost everything and is near impossible to clean up without lots of solvent and brand new rags.

"Okay lots of bad advice in here from other posters.  First off just running water is an issue as Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Most coolant is based on ethylene glycol, a form of alcohol that features a boiling point of 387 degrees Fahrenheit. So right off the bat just having water in your cooling system is not good. You need to flush the system and properly refill it with the correct mix of coolant.  Second big issue is your coolant doesn’t just disappear as it’s a sealed system. So where did the coolant go? Either you blew a hose or radiator, and lost coolant that way, which you really should have noticed. Or your engine is consuming it through a head gasket leak into your engine oil, or your engine is burning the coolant. Check your oil and see what it looks like, if it’s like chocolate milk then your head gasket or head is cracked and leaking or into the oil. If that seems good you need to check and see if you are burning coolant. Start the vehicle and have someone rev the motor and look for smoke as they do it. Burnt coolant smells sweet.   Educated guess is your vehicle is not okay. You need to figure out what’s going on.",Adding water won’t damage anything however my concern would be where the coolant disappeared to. Even if it were overheating from lack of coolant circulation the fluid shouldn’t just disappear,1

"Yes, but also no.  The paint of a car will deteriorate on very sunny or hot days.  However, that's the kind of thing to be concerned with if you leave it outside every day, not the occasional day. It's the kind of thing that develops over a decade, not a weekend.   The interior can also see the same kind of damage over time.  The plastics might crack or have slight color changes.  Again, it's a long term kind of issue, not a now and then issue.  Now if you live somewhere with a lot of suns, you'd be much more conserned.  If you lived in a warm climate it's a bigger issue.

The oil will interfere with the rotating parts and cause excessive drag.  There may be some aeration of the oil if this happens, but modern oils contain additives that minimize this as an issue.

A lot of shops are willing to charge a reasonable amount (like less than 1 hour's worth of labor) to test the A/C system, and they should be able to identify the problem.

Consider a more comfortable reliable daily and keep the wrx for weekends,"I was in a similar situation with a Mazdaspeed3 that was heavily modified (talking like big turbo running on the edge of what the long block should take). I looked at getting a Niro solely because it got great mpg, good warranty, and I couldn't fuck with it even if I wanted to. But at the time I felt like it was a lot of money for a car because I had never bought anything brand new or that expensive before. For some unknown reason I actually bought a Hyundai Genesis 5.0. Decent features but felt dated. Got shitty mpg, high insurance, transmission bothered me after a while (cars can't just go from 8th gear to 3rd which I learned over time) and while it had good power, it wasn't blow me away fast. Had some good buyers remorse on that deal for other reasons as well. Then it started throwing CEL's for O2 lean banks. Cleared the codes and traded it for a brand new Tacoma. Had I gotten a Niro, I think I would still have that.  &#x200B;  You'll probably get used to the lame power in a DD. I did. It's honestly refreshing to just drive a bone stock brand new car. I don't want to race anyone and I just don't worry about anything on it.  It was worth the peace of mind to me and really hasn't made an impact on my finances like I thought it would. I still max out a 401k and still have plenty of money to play around with each month. And the truck part has given me a lot of utility I didn't have before. Not sure what your financial situation is or how much of a strain it would be to upgrade but my quality of life went up by not worrying about shit breaking. Would be double bonus points if I got good mpg but truck lyfe. I take multi state trips now just for fun and don't worry about breaking down. At all.  As a side note, my mom ended up getting a Kona.. We test drove an AWD 1.6t and it was a fun car for what it was. Tech has come a long way. The little 1.6t will feel snappier in DD scenarios than your WRX. These things make peak torque at like <2500 rpm or something absurd. The 7 speed dual clutch was good on the test drive too. Hatch was a bit smaller than my Speed, but decent space with seats folded down. Hers is pretty base model but still has heated seats, carplay, lane keep assist, blind spot. Not sure what exact Hyundai you were looking at but I think you'd be happy with something like that.",1

Clamp a padded chunk of wood across the opening so you have a stop, then work the dent out gently starting at the crease and working that out. Don't hit anything but the vertical surface though, if you can get it to move out it will pull the upper dent out with it.

"As load increases on the electrical system the alternator will draw more load off the engine. That applies to any vehicle not just newer ones.  As far as how much it would affect mileage, not much at all under normal circumstances.  Lets do a rough quick estimate, the average car needs about 20HP to maintain 60 MPH on a totally flat road, so lets say you're using 20HP which is 15,000W of power out of your engines crank shaft.  You turn on your radio which at a very loud volume will use something like 20W of power, now your car is using 15,020W to maintain 60MPH. Such a small difference that you wouldn't be able to see a difference in fuel usage.  The average alternator can supply about 50-70A, so for fun lets say you turn literally everything on and you have aftermarket lights and a stereo and other electronics, you max out the alternator which at 12V 70A is 840W of power and maintain that for the whole tank of gas.  Now your engine is producing 15,840W of power to maintain 60MPH, which is enough that you'd probably see a small percentage difference in your mileage, maybe 5% or so.","The majority of the resistance in the alternator is when it is producing amperage. If there is no amp draw, the resistance is small.  You can very easily spin an alternator by hand off the car. It actually will spin for a few revolutions on its own  when you spin it fast.",1
"The more load you have on your alternator, the harder it is to spin, so the engine has to use more fuel to keep at the same rpm.

Its much harder to spin because its got a load on it.","As load increases on the electrical system the alternator will draw more load off the engine. That applies to any vehicle not just newer ones.

"What year is the Jeep?  Based on mileage difference, the Lexus is an obvious reliability choice of most, HOWEVER... The Jeep is the flagship of the Jeep brand (sure, Wrangler may be the face, but the GC is the one they give the most fucks about) and as such has had some of the best build quality FCA has, and generally speaking the better trim an FCA vehicle is, the better the reliability. There's a reason you can still easily find every generation of Grand Cherokee on the road today, you don't have that when things are unreliable and break often.  Provided the Jeep is a 2014+ if you really want it, don't hesitate to go for it if it passes an initial look-over. They've been around for long enough that they've ironed out the problems, and the only thing that was notably new for 2014 was the ZF 8-speed trans, which has shown great reliability (All other new parts like the radio had existed in other models for a while).  If it's pre-2013... Get the Lexus. Pre-2013 isn't BAD, but for that price I definitely wouldn't, and they use an older 5-speed transmission that's not quite as nice a pairing with the engine.  A lot of the internet has a major bias against FCA, and as you may be able to tell from my username, I'm a fan... But I also can admit when they build shit and will tell you which FCA vehicles to avoid... Which is oddly enough the trims/models enthusiasts wouldn't want anyway. The Grand Cherokee is on the short list of FCA vehicles where I'd feel confident in suggesting it randomly to someone and not expect it to break on them.  Edit: also, for the people complaining about plastic interiors... That's what you get when you buy a base-model vehicle. The whole interior of the SRT will be leather, including the dash and upper 2/3 of the door panels, and the headliner and pillars should be suede wrapped. The plastic that exists will also be plastic in the correlating location the the Lexus... Aside from maybe the glovebox door.  Also, FCA's infotainment is probably the best you can find for functionality short of Tesla. Even most reviewers who hate FCA admit it.","If what you want is hot, nasty bad-ass speed at all costs, other considerations be damned, the SRT is your vehicle. Do be aware that it's neither as well-built nor will the miles have been as easy.  But if you want 4x4 capability, craftsmanship, refinement and are willing to put up with a rapidly dated interior & UI, the Lexus is your option. I'm willing to bet its 22k miles were put on at a much gentler pace than the Jeep.   Personally I would get the Lexus if I could have one car since I tend to bond with vehicles and keep them for a long time.",1
